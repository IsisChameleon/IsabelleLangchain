Scheme (NDIS) is\\nsubject to regulation by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) and the NDIS Quality and\\nSafeguards Commission through the provisions of the National Disability Insurance

arrangements and price limits that the NDIA has\\ndetermined will apply to the provision of supports for participants in the NDIS. The intent of these\\ndocuments is to assist participants and providers, both current and prospective, to understand the\\nways in which price controls work in the NDIS. Price regulation is in place to help ensure that\\nparticipants receive value for money when they purchase the supports that they need.\\nPrice regulation documents\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits\\nThis document sets out the general pricing arrangements that apply to all supports in the NDIS and\\nthe specific arrangements that apply to individual supports.\\nNDIS Support Catalogue\\nThis document provides information on the current price limits for each support item and indicates\\nfor each price-limited support item the claim types (Travel, non-face-to-face, etc.) that can be used.\\nRequirements specified in the Support Catalogue are part of the pricing arrangements and price\\nlimits that the NDIA has determined should apply to NDIS.\\nThe NDIA sometimes deactivates support items. Deactivated support items cannot be used.\\nBefore a support is deactivated it is converted into a Legacy Support for a period of time. These\\nlegacy supports are listed in a separate tab of the Support Catalogue for the information of\\nproviders and participants. Providers and participants should not create new service bookings for\\nlegacy supports. In general, claims for legacy supports should only continue to be made against a\\nservice booking if that service booking was in existence at the time the support was turned into a\\nlegacy support.\\nAddenda to the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits\\nThese documents allow the NDIA to respond to changing market conditions in an efficient manner.\\nThey are used to make temporary changes to some of the support items and arrangements listed\\nin the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Addenda are not stand-alone documents and\\nmust be read in conjunction with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Requirements\\nspecified in Addenda are part of the pricing arrangements and price limits that the NDIA has\\ndetermined will apply to NDIS.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation\\nThis document sets out the specific pricing arrangements that apply for Specialist Disability\\nAccommodation (SDA).

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal.

When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101', metadata={'source': '../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'file_path': '../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'page': 15, 'total_pages': 101, 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_Enabled': 'true', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_SetDate': '2022-02-24T21:20:38Z', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_Method': 'Privileged', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_Name': 'OFFICIAL', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_SiteId': 'cd778b65-752d-454a-87cf-b9990fe58993', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_ActionId': 'a41679f1-751c-43a0-a310-7842fbe5f727', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_ContentBits': '0', 'Title': 'NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24', 'Author': 'Rundle, Vincent', 'Creator': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'CreationDate': \"D:20230615172130+10'00'\", 'ModDate': \"D:20230615172130+10'00'\", 'Producer': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365'}), Document(page_content='General Claiming Rules\\n• A Night-time Sleepover Support is any support to a participant delivered on a weekday, a\\nSaturday, a Sunday or a Public Holiday that:\\no Commences before midnight on a day and finishes after midnight on that day;

However, some different pricing arrangements do apply in Regional Areas\\n(MMM4-5) as set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\nWhen a support is provided directly to a participant, and the worker delivering the support is at the\\nsame location as the participant, the price limit that applies to the support is determined by the\\nlocation of the participant at the time of service delivery. For example, if a participant living in a\\nRemote location visits a provider to receive a service, the support is subject to the price limit that\\napplies to that location – not the Remote price limit.\\nWhen a support is provided directly to a participant via telehealth, the price limit that applies to the\\nsupport should, in general, be the price limit that would apply if the participant was receiving the\\nsupport at the place that the person who is delivering the support is located at the time of service\\ndelivery. However, participants in Remote or Very Remote areas can agree that those price limits\\nshould apply to the support if they are satisfied that the support provides value for money.\\nWhen a support is not provided directly (for example, Non-Face-to-Face Support Provision or\\nNDIA Requested Reports) then the price limit that applies to the support is the price limit that\\nwould apply if the participant was receiving the support at the place that the person who is\\ndelivering the support is located at the time of service delivery.\\nClaiming for Group-Based Supports\\nWhen a support item is delivered to more than one participant at the same time (a group of\\nparticipants) then, unless the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits states otherwise, the\\nprice limit for each participant is the applicable price limit set out in the relevant support table\\ndivided by the number of participants in the group. Providers should make a claim for each\\nparticipant using the relevant support item. Each claim should be for the total time of the support\\nbut is subject to the lower price limit as set out above.\\nProviders can only claim for supports that are related to the reasonable and necessary needs of a\\nparticipant. Where a participant attends a group-based session then a provider should only claim\\nfor the time of more than one worker against that participant’s plan if all those workers were\\ninvolved in the direct support of the participant for the time claimed.\\nThere are transitional arrangements in place for group-based supports in the Assistance with\\nSocial, Economic and Community Participation Support Category, see page 62.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 28 of 101', metadata={'source': '../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'file_path': '../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'page': 28, 'total_pages': 101, 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_Enabled': 'true', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_SetDate': '2022-02-24T21:20:38Z', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_Method': 'Privileged', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_Name': 'OFFICIAL', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_SiteId': 'cd778b65-752d-454a-87cf-b9990fe58993', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_ActionId': 'a41679f1-751c-43a0-a310-7842fbe5f727', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_ContentBits': '0', 'Title': 'NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24', 'Author': 'Rundle, Vincent', 'Creator': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'CreationDate': \"D:20230615172130+10'00'\", 'ModDate': \"D:20230615172130+10'00'\", 'Producer': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365'}), Document(page_content='General Claiming Rules\\nPrograms of Support\\nA provider of group-based supports in any of the following categories can enter into an agreement\\nwith a participant for a “program of support”, especially where the program is towards the\\nachievement of a specified outcome:\\n• Any support in the Assistance in Shared Living Arrangements – Supported Independent\\nLiving section of the Assistance with Daily Life Support Category;\\n• Any support in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation Support\\nCategory, including Supports in Employment; and\\n• Any support in any Capacity Building Support Category.\\nUnder this approach, providers claim against the plans of all the participants who had agreed to\\nattend an instance of support in the program of support as though they had attended (whether or\\nnot they did) – as long as the provider had the capacity to deliver the support.

They may also include a period of respite, which aims to support ongoing caring\\narrangements between participants and their carers. STA/respite allows the opportunity for the\\nparticipant to be supported by someone else whilst providing their carer with short term breaks\\nfrom their usual caring responsibilities.\\nThe support items include all expenses in a 24-hour period including assistance with self-care or\\ncommunity access activities, accommodation, food and negotiated activities. Typically, this type of\\nsupport would be used for short periods of up to 14 days at a time (exceptions may be made). For\\nlonger-term arrangements, other options are likely to be more appropriate (e.g., Supported\\nIndependent Living or Medium Term Accommodation).\\nIn cases where a participant will receive substantially less than 24 hours of assistance with daily\\npersonal activities, it may be appropriate for the participant and provider to negotiate a lower price\\nthan the maximum price specified in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits, based on\\nthe actual hours of support provided. This situation might arise, for example, if a participant enters\\na STA/respite facility in the evening, and exits again early the following morning. In addition, where\\na participant enters accommodation late in the day, it may be appropriate to claim the daily rate for\\nthe day of the week that the majority of the support is provided.\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\nAs well as direct service provision, these support items can be used to claim for:\\n• Short Notice Cancellations.\\nThese support items are subject to price limits as set out in the following Table.

They are available during the final months at school and\\ncontinue post school exit. These supports are designed to plan and implement a pathway to\\ninclusive employment, focussing on capacity building for goal achievement. With appropriate\\nsupports, it is expected that the majority of SLES participants will transition to the Disability\\nEmployment Service (DES) to undertake the job seeking, placement and post placement support\\nphases of their pathway. These supports will have an individualised approach, with a strong\\nemphasis on “try and test” work experience opportunities, (generally in work places that would pay\\naward wages). Capacity building should focus on hard and soft skill development. Supports, more\\ngenerally, should facilitate positive experiences that contribute to developing an understanding of\\nwork capability and confidence to step into employment. SLES should also help inform the level\\nand nature of future supports needed to obtain and sustain employment.\\nThis support item can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the NDIS\\nPricing Arrangements and Price Limits.

The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 11 of 101\\n\\t4. Lifelong Learning\\t\\t\\t8. Choice and ControlSupport Purposes, Support Categories and Support Items\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n4. Lifelong Learning 8. Choice and Control\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must\\ncontribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan. Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and\\nproviders to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant’s goals.\\nThe following table shows the links between support purpose types, domains in the Outcomes\\nFramework and support categories.\\nPURPOSE OUTCOME DOMAIN 1.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101', metadata={'title': 'NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24', 'source': '/workspaces/IsabelleLangchain/src/ndis/../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'timestamp': '2023-08-06T09:01:37.029528', 'start_page': 11, 'end_page': 15}), 0.44298630952835083)]\n",

Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel. The non-labour costs should be claimed against the\\nrelevant “Provider Travel – non-labour costs” support item as indicated in the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits.\\nSupport items\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a worker is travelling to provide services to\\nmore than one participant in a ‘region’ then the provider should apportion the non-labour travel\\ncosts (including the return journey where applicable) between the participants, with the agreement\\nof each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 11 of 101\\n\\t4. Lifelong Learning\\t\\t\\t8.

Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and\\nproviders to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant’s goals.\\nThe following table shows the links between support purpose types, domains in the Outcomes\\nFramework and support categories.\\nPURPOSE OUTCOME DOMAIN 1.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal.

They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101', metadata={'title': 'NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24', 'source': '/workspaces/IsabelleLangchain/src/ndis/../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'timestamp': '2023-08-06T09:01:37.029528', 'start_page': 11, 'end_page': 15})], 'question': 'What item code should I use when invoicing for a participant?

An exception to this general rule occurs when a particular support\\ncrosses a shift boundary and the same worker delivers the entire support.

This support item\\nincludes up to two hours of active supports provided to the participant for the duration of the period.\\nProviders may claim for the third or additional hour at Saturday rates on weekdays, or at applicable\\nrates on other days (Saturday, Sunday or Public Holidays).\\nNote, there is no night-time sleepover support item for nurses.\\nClaiming for Telehealth Services\\nTelehealth can be used to deliver direct supports where appropriate and with the agreement of the\\nparticipant.\\nProviders can only claim Telehealth Services where the following conditions are met:\\n• The delivery of the support by telehealth is appropriate; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and with the Service Agreement with the participant; and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant (rather\\nthan a general activity such as enrolment, administration or staff rostering); and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider specifies that Telehealth services can be claimed).\\nProviders have a duty of care to their participants to ensure they are providing the same standard\\nof care through video technology as in a clinical setting.\\nClaims for Telehealth Services should be made using the relevant support item as indicated in\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits by using the “Telehealth Services” option in the\\nmyplace portal.\\nClaiming for Non-direct Services\\nNon-Face-to-Face Support Provision\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for the Non-Face-to-Face delivery of a support\\nitem if all of the following conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for Non-\\nFace-to-Face Support Provision in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and with the Service Agreement with the participant; and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant or in\\nthe case of group-based supports, are required to enable the group support to be delivered\\n(rather than a general activity such as enrolment, administration or staff rostering); and\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 17 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider specifies that Non-Face-to-Face supports can be\\nclaimed).\\nFor example, the Assistance with Self Care support items are described as covering activities\\n“Assisting with, and/or supervising, personal tasks of daily life to develop skills of the participant to\\nlive as autonomously as possible”. Therefore, time spent on Non-Face-to-Face activities that assist\\nthe participant – for example, writing reports for co-workers and other providers about the client’s\\nprogress with skill development – could be claimed against this support item.\\nThe costs of training and up-skilling staff, and of supervision, are included in the base price limits\\nfor supports and are not considered billable Non-Face-to-Face supports. However, research\\nundertaken by a capacity-building provider specifically linked to the needs of a participant and to\\nthe achievement of the participant’s goals may be billable as a Non-Face-to-Face support with the\\nparticipant’s prior agreement.\\nService agreements with each client can ‘pre-authorise’ these activities, but providers should only\\nclaim a support item from a participant’s plan if they have completed activities that are part of the\\nsupport for that participant. Charging a fee that is not linked to completed activities is not permitted.\\nTime spent on administration, such as the processing of NDIS payment claims for all clients,\\nshould not be claimed from a participant’s budget as a Non-Face-to-Face support.

(Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs.

The non-labour costs should be claimed against the\\nrelevant “Provider Travel – non-labour costs” support item as indicated in the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits.\\nSupport items\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a worker is travelling to provide services to\\nmore than one participant in a ‘region’ then the provider should apportion the non-labour travel\\ncosts (including the return journey where applicable) between the participants, with the agreement\\nof each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 11 of 101\\n\\t4. Lifelong Learning\\t\\t\\t8. Choice and ControlSupport Purposes, Support Categories and Support Items\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n4. Lifelong Learning 8. Choice and Control\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must\\ncontribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan. Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and\\nproviders to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant’s goals.\\nThe following table shows the links between support purpose types, domains in the Outcomes\\nFramework and support categories.\\nPURPOSE OUTCOME DOMAIN 1.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101'}\n",

In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

Providers should assist participants to minimise the travel\\ncosts that they need to pay (for example, by co-ordinating appointments with other participants in\\nan area, so that travel costs can be shared between participants, or by considering the delivery of\\nthe support by telehealth where appropriate).\\nShort Notice Cancellations\\nWhere a provider has a Short Notice Cancellation (or no show), they are able to claim 100% of the\\nagreed fee associated with the activity from the participant’s plan, subject to the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits and the terms of the service agreement with the participant.\\nA cancellation is a short notice cancellation if the participant:\\n• Does not show up for a scheduled support within a reasonable time, or is not present at the\\nagreed place and within a reasonable time when the provider is travelling to deliver the\\nsupport; or\\n• Has given less than seven (7) clear days’ notice for a support.\\nFor supports delivered to a group of participants, if a participant cancels their attendance and if the\\nprovider is unable find another participant to attend the group session in their place then, if the\\nother requirements for a short notice cancellation are met, the provider is permitted to bill the\\nparticipant who has made the short notice cancellation at the previously agreed rate that they\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 22 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\t\\n\\tA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\t\\n\\tThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\t\\n\\tnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\t\\n\\twould have been spent providing the support.\\t\\n\\tIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\t\\n\\tprovider can claim for this support.

All other participants in the group\\nshould also be billed as though all participants had attended the group.\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a Short Notice Cancellation of the delivery of\\na support item to the participant if all of the following conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for Short\\nNotice Cancellations in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify that Short Notice Cancellations can be\\nclaimed); and\\n• The provider was not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and are\\nrequired to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.\\nClaims for a short notice cancellation should be made using the same support item as would have\\nbeen used if the support had been delivered, using the “Cancellation” option in the myplace portal.\\nThere is no hard limit on the number of short notice cancellations (or no shows) for which a\\nprovider can claim in respect of a participant. However, providers have a duty of care to their\\nparticipants and if a participant has an unusual number of cancellations, then the provider should\\nseek to understand why they are occurring. The NDIA will monitor claims for cancellations and may\\ncontact providers who have a participant with an unusual number of cancellations.\\nExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\nA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\nThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\nnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\nwould have been spent providing the support.\\nIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\nprovider can claim for this support. The claim should be made at the agreed rate for the service against the relevant\\nsupport item using the drop-down field “Cancellation”.\\nNDIA Requested Reports\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a NDIA Requested Report if all of the\\nfollowing conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for NDIA\\nRequested Reports in respect of that support item and the proposed charges for the activities\\ncomply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (i.e., the service agreement\\nwith the participant should specify that NDIA Requested Reports can be claimed); and\\n• The report is requested by the NDIA.\\nA report is considered to have been requested by the NDIA if it is a report that is required at the\\ncommencement of a plan that outlines plan objectives and goals, or at plan review that measures\\nfunctional outcomes against the originally stipulated goals, or that makes recommendations for\\nongoing needs (informal, community, mainstream or funded supports). Providers may also claim\\nfor other NDIA-requested therapy report that is stipulated as being required in a participant’s plan.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 23 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaims for NDIS requested reports should be made using the relevant support item, using the\\n“NDIA Report” option in the myplace portal.\\nClaiming for Activity Based Transport\\nActivity Based Transport – Social, Economic and Community Participation Supports\\nProviders of supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation\\nSupport Category (“community participation supports”) can, at the request of a participant,\\ntransport a participant to, or from, or as part of, a community participation support. In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 11 of 101\\n\\t4. Lifelong Learning\\t\\t\\t8.

Choice and Control\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must\\ncontribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan. Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and\\nproviders to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant’s goals.\\nThe following table shows the links between support purpose types, domains in the Outcomes\\nFramework and support categories.\\nPURPOSE OUTCOME DOMAIN 1.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101', metadata={'title': 'NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24', 'source': '/workspaces/IsabelleLangchain/src/ndis/../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'timestamp': '2023-08-06T09:01:37.029528', 'start_page': 11, 'end_page': 15}), 0.44298630952835083)]\n",

However, research\\nundertaken by a capacity-building provider specifically linked to the needs of a participant and to\\nthe achievement of the participant’s goals may be billable as a Non-Face-to-Face support with the\\nparticipant’s prior agreement.\\nService agreements with each client can ‘pre-authorise’ these activities, but providers should only\\nclaim a support item from a participant’s plan if they have completed activities that are part of the\\nsupport for that participant. Charging a fee that is not linked to completed activities is not permitted.\\nTime spent on administration, such as the processing of NDIS payment claims for all clients,\\nshould not be claimed from a participant’s budget as a Non-Face-to-Face support.

Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel. The non-labour costs should be claimed against the\\nrelevant “Provider Travel – non-labour costs” support item as indicated in the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits.\\nSupport items\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 11 of 101\\n\\t4. Lifelong Learning\\t\\t\\t8. Choice and ControlSupport Purposes, Support Categories and Support Items\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n4. Lifelong Learning 8. Choice and Control\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must\\ncontribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan. Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101', metadata={'title': 'NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24', 'source': '/workspaces/IsabelleLangchain/src/ndis/../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'timestamp': '2023-08-06T09:01:37.029528', 'start_page': 11, 'end_page': 15})], 'question': 'What item code should I use when invoicing for a participant?

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 11 of 101\\n\\t4. Lifelong Learning\\t\\t\\t8. Choice and ControlSupport Purposes, Support Categories and Support Items\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n4. Lifelong Learning 8. Choice and Control\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must\\ncontribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan. Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and\\nproviders to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant’s goals.\\nThe following table shows the links between support purpose types, domains in the Outcomes\\nFramework and support categories.\\nPURPOSE OUTCOME DOMAIN 1.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101'}\n",

In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

Providers should assist participants to minimise the travel\\ncosts that they need to pay (for example, by co-ordinating appointments with other participants in\\nan area, so that travel costs can be shared between participants, or by considering the delivery of\\nthe support by telehealth where appropriate).\\nShort Notice Cancellations\\nWhere a provider has a Short Notice Cancellation (or no show), they are able to claim 100% of the\\nagreed fee associated with the activity from the participant’s plan, subject to the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits and the terms of the service agreement with the participant.\\nA cancellation is a short notice cancellation if the participant:\\n• Does not show up for a scheduled support within a reasonable time, or is not present at the\\nagreed place and within a reasonable time when the provider is travelling to deliver the\\nsupport; or\\n• Has given less than seven (7) clear days’ notice for a support.\\nFor supports delivered to a group of participants, if a participant cancels their attendance and if the\\nprovider is unable find another participant to attend the group session in their place then, if the\\nother requirements for a short notice cancellation are met, the provider is permitted to bill the\\nparticipant who has made the short notice cancellation at the previously agreed rate that they\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 22 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\t\\n\\tA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\t\\n\\tThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\t\\n\\tnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\t\\n\\twould have been spent providing the support.\\t\\n\\tIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\t\\n\\tprovider can claim for this support.

All other participants in the group\\nshould also be billed as though all participants had attended the group.\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a Short Notice Cancellation of the delivery of\\na support item to the participant if all of the following conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for Short\\nNotice Cancellations in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify that Short Notice Cancellations can be\\nclaimed); and\\n• The provider was not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and are\\nrequired to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.\\nClaims for a short notice cancellation should be made using the same support item as would have\\nbeen used if the support had been delivered, using the “Cancellation” option in the myplace portal.\\nThere is no hard limit on the number of short notice cancellations (or no shows) for which a\\nprovider can claim in respect of a participant. However, providers have a duty of care to their\\nparticipants and if a participant has an unusual number of cancellations, then the provider should\\nseek to understand why they are occurring. The NDIA will monitor claims for cancellations and may\\ncontact providers who have a participant with an unusual number of cancellations.\\nExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\nA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\nThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\nnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\nwould have been spent providing the support.\\nIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\nprovider can claim for this support. The claim should be made at the agreed rate for the service against the relevant\\nsupport item using the drop-down field “Cancellation”.\\nNDIA Requested Reports\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a NDIA Requested Report if all of the\\nfollowing conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for NDIA\\nRequested Reports in respect of that support item and the proposed charges for the activities\\ncomply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (i.e., the service agreement\\nwith the participant should specify that NDIA Requested Reports can be claimed); and\\n• The report is requested by the NDIA.\\nA report is considered to have been requested by the NDIA if it is a report that is required at the\\ncommencement of a plan that outlines plan objectives and goals, or at plan review that measures\\nfunctional outcomes against the originally stipulated goals, or that makes recommendations for\\nongoing needs (informal, community, mainstream or funded supports). Providers may also claim\\nfor other NDIA-requested therapy report that is stipulated as being required in a participant’s plan.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 23 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaims for NDIS requested reports should be made using the relevant support item, using the\\n“NDIA Report” option in the myplace portal.\\nClaiming for Activity Based Transport\\nActivity Based Transport – Social, Economic and Community Participation Supports\\nProviders of supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation\\nSupport Category (“community participation supports”) can, at the request of a participant,\\ntransport a participant to, or from, or as part of, a community participation support. In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker.

(Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs.
