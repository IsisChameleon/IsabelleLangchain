Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) is one of the supports that may be funded under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) for some participants. SDA funding is provided to participants who require a specialist dwelling that reduces their need for person-to- person supports, or improves the efficiency of the delivery of person-to-person supports. SDA funding is only provided for participants who meet the eligibility criteria. Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will have an extreme functional impairment and/or very high support needs.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nIn brief, in order to receive NDIS SDA payments in respect of a participant living in a dwelling:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nthe provider must be a registered NDIS provider with the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission (NDIS Q&SC); and\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nthe provider must be approved for the SDA Registration Group by the NDIS Q&SC; and\\n\\n(iii)\\n\\nthe provider must have enrolled the dwelling with the NDIA; and\\n\\n(iv)\\n\\nthe SDA payment must be equal to or less than the maximum amount that the NDIA has determined that it will pay based on the age, location and features of the dwelling; and\\n\\n(v)\\n\\nthe NDIA must have determined that SDA is a reasonable and necessary support for the participant.1\\n\\nLegislative framework\\n\\n3. The legislative framework for providing SDA to participants under the NDIS, including the\\n\\ncriteria for when a participant will have SDA included in their NDIS plan, the dwellings that can be used for SDA and the payments that will be paid to providers of SDA are set out in:\\n\\nthe National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 (the NDIS Act) and the NDIS Rules under the Act, including the NDIS (Specialist Disability Accommodation) Rules 2020 (SDA Rules) and the NDIS (Specialist Disability Accommodation Conditions) Rule 2018 (SDA NDIS Q&SC Rule), which incorporate the NDIS (Specialist Disability Accommodation Conditions) Amendment Rules 2020;\\n\\n(i)\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nthis NDIS Pricing Arrangements for SDA; and\\n\\n(iii)\\n\\nthe general NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\n\\n4. This NDIS Pricing Arrangements for SDA is referred to as the SDA Price Guide in the SDA Rules and contains further detail regarding the Design Categories and Building Types described in the SDA Rules.\\n\\n5. This NDIS Pricing Arrangements for SDA also sets out the price limits for particular SDA types\\n\\nand locations, including allowances for features.\\n\\n6. Further information to assist Providers is available through the NDIS website..\\n\\n1 If a provider was registered with the NDIA in a jurisdiction prior to the commencement of the NDIS Q&SC in that jurisdiction, then the provider is taken to have been registered by the NDIS Q&SC. If a dwelling was enrolled with the NDIS Q&SC immediately prior to 23 June 2020 then the dwelling is taken to have been enrolled by the NDIA.\\n\\n5\\n\\nRegistered Providers’ Obligations\\n\\nRegistration\\n\\n7. All SDA providers must be registered for the SDA Registration Group by the NDIS Quality and\\n\\nSafeguards Commission (NDIS Q&SC).\\n\\nEnrolment\\n\\n8. The dwelling for which SDA is claimed must have been enrolled with the NDIS Q&SC (prior to 23 June 2020) or be enrolled with the NDIA (after 23 June 2020). The requirements that must be met for a dwelling to be enrolled are set out in the SDA Rules and, for dwellings that were enrolled with the NDIS Q&SC prior to 23 June 2020, the SDA NDIS Q&SC Rule. In summary, the requirements are that the dwelling:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nIs a permanent dwelling (for example, it is not a mobile home).\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nIs intended to provide long-term accommodation for at least one SDA eligible participant (for example, is not used only for respite, emergency or temporary accommodation).\\n\\n(iii)\\n\\nIs not already being funded as accommodation by the Commonwealth, a State or Territory under a scheme unrelated to disability.\\n\\n(iv)\\n\\nIs not excluded from SDA because it has previously received home modifications funding from the NDIA of the type described in s 25 of the SDA Rules.\\n\\n(v) Meets the requirements of a New Build (including density restrictions), Existing Stock or\\n\\nLegacy Stock set out in the SDA Rules, and this NDIS Pricing Arrangements for SDA, including:\\n\\n(a) For New Builds and New Builds (refurbished) - all its shared areas and any\\n\\nbedrooms for use by SDA-eligible participants must comply with the SDA Design Standard2 for the Design Category of the dwelling; or\\n\\n(b) For Existing Stock - all its shared areas and any bedrooms for use by SDA-eligible\\n\\nparticipants substantially comply with the Minimum Design Requirements set out below in this NDIS Pricing Arrangements for SDA for the Design Category of the dwelling; or\\n\\n(c) For Legacy Stock - all its shared areas and any bedrooms for use by SDA-eligible\\n\\nparticipants comply, or substantially comply, with the Minimum Design Requirements set out below in this NDIS Pricing Arrangements for SDA for the Design Category of the dwelling.\\n\\n9. The registered provider must have the certifications required by the SDA Rules or the SDA\\n\\nNDIS Q&SC Rule that the dwelling:\\n\\n(i) Complies with the SDA Rules and the SDA NDIS Q&SC Rule, and this NDIS Pricing\\n\\nArrangements for SDA; and\\n\\n(ii) Meets all applicable building codes and laws.\\n\\n2 The SDA Design Standard became the Minimum Design Requirements for New Builds and New Build (refurbished) from 1 July 2021 (see below).\\n\\n6\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation 2023-24\\n\\nObligations\\n\\n10. A registered provider of SDA:\\n\\n(i) Must have a written service agreement for SDA with the participant or, if agreement\\n\\ncannot be reached, work with the participant to establish an agreement.\\n\\n(ii) Must ensure the written service agreement for SDA is compliant with the NDIS Terms of Business (Appendix I – SDA Terms of Business), which set out the matters that must be included in the agreement.\\n\\n(iii) Must provide a copy of the written service agreement for SDA to the participant.\\n\\n(iv) Must act in accordance with the terms of the service agreement for SDA.\\n\\n(v) Must comply with all Commonwealth, State or Territory laws that apply to the provision of SDA and must have mechanisms in place to ensure ongoing compliance, including in relation to employees, contractors or other persons engaged by the provider.\\n\\n(vi) Must ensure their dwellings are correctly enrolled and meet the requirements for the\\n\\nenrolment of the dwellings.\\n\\n(vii) Must provide all required notifications, including keeping the NDIA up to date including in\\n\\nrelation to vacancies.\\n\\n(viii) Must ensure dwellings do not exceed the maximum number of residents declared by the\\n\\nprovider as the number for which the dwelling is enrolled.\\n\\n(ix) Must, if the dwelling is a New Build, comply with the density restrictions set out in the\\n\\nSDA Rules.\\n\\n11. A registered provider’s approval can be revoked if the provider does not meet the obligations\\n\\nimposed on them by the SDA Rules.\\n\\nClaiming Payment for SDA\\n\\n12. As for all NDIS supports, Registered Providers can make a claim for SDA payment after that support has been delivered or provided. Standard claiming frequency for SDA is monthly, however the frequency can be flexible as long as it is in arrears.\\n\\n13. When claiming payment for SDA from an individual participant’s plan, a provider is only able to\\n\\nclaim the lesser of:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nThe maximum per participant price for which the dwelling is enrolled; and\\n\\n(ii) The amount of SDA funding for which a participant has been assessed i.e. the amount of\\n\\nSDA in their plan.\\n\\nFor example, if a participant has been found eligible to receive $90,000 per annum in SDA funding and the dwelling has been enrolled with a maximum per participant price of $30,000, the maximum payment that could be claimed from this participant’s plan is $30,000 unless Appendix H – Shared living arrangements applies. Similarly, if a participant has been found eligible to receive $30,000 per annum in SDA funding and the dwelling has been enrolled with a maximum per participant price of $90,000, the maximum payment that could be claimed from this participant’s plan is $30,000 unless Appendix H – Shared living arrangements applies.\\n\\n14. SDA is only paid while a participant resides in the dwelling or, in very limited cases, for a\\n\\nperiod after a vacancy arises (outlined below).\\n\\n7\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation 2023-24\\n\\n15. Payment for SDA can only be claimed when a registered provider meets all of the criteria to be eligible for the payment as set out in the NDIS Act and the NDIS Rules made under the Act, including the SDA Rules and the SDA NDIS Q&SC Rule, and related documents.\\n\\n16. Claims for payment by a provider must be for a specific Design Category and Building Type\\n\\nthat is identified by the provider when enrolling the dwelling. The provider must ensure that the dwelling meets all of the requirements of the Design Category and Building Type for the claim made.\\n\\nClaiming for the Specialist Disability Accommodation Support Item\\n\\n17. Providers must use the SDA Quotable Amount support item to claim for SDA when that\\n\\nsupport item is stated in the participant’s plan and the funds are agency managed and the quote has been accepted by the agency. This support item can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in this NDIS Pricing Arrangements for SDA and the SDA Rules 2020. The price limit for the support item for a given participant is the amount stated in their plan.\\n\\nPrice Limits\\n\\nVery Remote\\n\\nItem Number\\n\\nItem Name and Notes\\n\\nUnit\\n\\nNational Remote\\n\\nSpecialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) - Quotable Amount\\n\\n06_431_0131_2_2\\n\\nEach\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nN/A\\n\\n18. If a participant who is not currently residing in SDA has the SDA Quotable Amount support\\n\\nitem in their plan, then they need to have their plan reassessed or varied to include the SDA amount before they can move into an SDA property.\\n\\nClaiming Payment for SDA Vacancy\\n\\n19. There are very limited circumstances in which SDA payments may continue for a period of\\n\\ntime after a participant no longer physically resides at an enrolled SDA dwelling.\\n\\n20. A payment for SDA may be made from a participant’s plan even though the participant no\\n\\nlonger physically resides at an enrolled SDA dwelling when:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nThe SDA dwelling for the participant is enrolled to house two to five residents; and\\n\\n(ii) The participant either:\\n\\n(a) Dies; or\\n\\n(b) Gives notice that he or she will vacate the dwelling; or\\n\\n(c) Is given a notice to vacate because of behaviour that might represent a risk to other\\n\\nresidents, to staff or to the participant; and\\n\\n(iii) The vacancy is available for a participant and the NDIA has been notified.\\n\\n21. In these circumstances, the participant will be taken to reside in the dwelling until the vacancy\\n\\nis filled; or the earlier of the following:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nFor a dwelling that is enrolled to house four or five residents - 90 days after the day of the event mentioned in paragraph 20(ii); or\\n\\n(ii) For a dwelling that is enrolled to house two or three residents - 60 days after the day of\\n\\nthe event mentioned in paragraph 20(ii).\\n\\n8\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation 2023-24\\n\\nClaiming for the SDA Vacancy - Person-Specific Adjustment Support Item\\n\\n22. This support item is a temporary payment for providers, available in limited circumstances\\n\\nwhen a participant moves out of an SDA dwelling that accommodates 2 or more residents. It can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in this NDIS Pricing Arrangements for SDA and the SDA Rules 2020.\\n\\n23. This support item is subject to quotation. It should only be used if it is a stated item in a plan\\n\\nand only if the funds are agency managed.\\n\\nPrice Limits\\n\\nVery Remote\\n\\nItem Number\\n\\nItem Name and Notes\\n\\nUnit\\n\\nNational Remote\\n\\nSDA Vacancy - Person-Specific Adjustment\\n\\n06_432_0131_2_2\\n\\nEach\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nPrepayments\\n\\n24. Registered Providers can only make a claim for payment for a support once that support has been delivered or provided. Where price limits apply, prices charged to participants must not exceed the price limit prescribed for that support.\\n\\n25. Registered Providers can make a claim for payment once a service booking has been created and the support has been delivered or provided. Prepayment is not permitted unless the NDIA has given prior approval in writing to the Registered Provider. This will only occur in exceptional circumstances such as for certain assistive technologies, home modifications and remote area servicing where this has been agreed to by the participant.\\n\\nMaximum Reasonable Rent Contribution\\n\\n26. The payment of SDA prices by the NDIA on behalf of a participant to a Provider does not prevent the Provider obtaining a reasonable rent contribution directly from the participant.\\n\\n27. The amount of rent a provider can charge must not exceed the amount of the maximum\\n\\nreasonable rent contribution (MRRC).\\n\\nThe maximum amount of rent if the participant does not share a bedroom\\n\\n28. Whether or not the participant receives the Disability Support Pension under the Social\\n\\nSecurity Act 1991 and no matter their age, the rent that they pay cannot be greater than the MRRC (Single) – which is an amount that is equal to:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\n25 percent of the maximum basic rate of the Disability Support Pension payable for a person who is not under 21 and not a member of a couple;\\n\\n(ii) Plus: 25 per cent of the maximum rate of the Pension Supplement payable for a person\\n\\nwho is not under 21 and not a member of a couple;\\n\\n(iii) Plus: 100 per cent of the maximum rate of Commonwealth Rent Assistance payable for\\n\\na person who is not under 21 and not a member of a couple and not sharing.\\n\\nThe maximum amount of rent if the participant shares a bedroom\\n\\n29. Whether or not the participant receives the Disability Support Pension under the Social\\n\\nSecurity Act 1991 and no matter their age, the rent they pay cannot be greater than the MRRC (Member of a Couple) – which is an amount that is equal to:\\n\\n9\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation 2023-24\\n\\n(i)\\n\\n25 percent of the maximum basic rate of the Disability Support Pension payable for a person who is not under 21 and is a member of a couple (not separated due to illness);\\n\\n(ii) Plus: 25 per cent of the maximum rate of the Pension Supplement payable for a person\\n\\nwho is not under 21 and is a member of a couple not separated due to illness);\\n\\n(iii) Plus: 100 per cent of the maximum rate of Commonwealth Rent Assistance payable for a person who is not under 21 and is a member of a couple (not separated due to illness) and not sharing.\\n\\nTable 1: Fortnightly Maximum Reasonable Rent Contribution\\n\\nSingle\\n\\nMember of a Couple (Each)\\n\\nPeriod\\n\\n20 March 2023 to 19 September 2023\\n\\n$419.68\\n\\n$271.86\\n\\n20 September 2022 to 19 March 2023\\n\\n$404.70\\n\\n$262.20\\n\\nVoluntary contributions above the maximum reasonable rent contribution\\n\\n30. In exceptional circumstances participants may choose to make a discretionary contribution\\n\\nover the MRRC. This can only occur:\\n\\n(i) where the participant, despite other available options, chooses to access a higher cost category of SDA than is funded by the NDIS (such as SDA in a different location or of a different type); or\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nif the market rental value for a particular dwelling is higher than the SDA price plus MRRC. This is unlikely but could occur due to a particular location.\\n\\n31. If a Registered Provider proposes to charge rent that exceeds the SDA price plus the MRRC because of the high market rental value for the property, the Provider must not charge the participant that higher rent until the requirements in the SDA Rules have been met:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nthe Provider must obtain and keep written certification from an appropriately qualified property valuer stating that the rent is fair and reasonable; and\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nthe Provider must notify the NDIA and provide the NDIA with a copy of the attestation referred to above.\\n\\n32. Any voluntary discretionary contribution arrangements are expected to be reflected in the rent\\n\\ncomponent of the written service agreement between a provider and participant.\\n\\nBoard payments\\n\\n33. The written service agreement must specify any board payments that have been agreed with the participant, what the board payments will cover and the method and timing of making the board payments.\\n\\nThe maximum amount of board if the participant does not share a bedroom\\n\\n34. Whether or not the participant receives the Disability Support Pension under the Social\\n\\nSecurity Act 1991 and no matter the participant’s age, any board must not exceed a maximum amount (see Table 2) that is:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\n50 per cent of maximum basic rate of the Disability Support Pension payable for a person who is not under 21 and is not a member of a couple;\\n\\n(ii) Plus: 100 per cent of the maximum rate of the Energy Supplement payable for a person\\n\\nwho is not under 21 and is not a member of a couple.\\n\\n10\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation 2023-24\\n\\nThe maximum amount of board if the participant shares a bedroom\\n\\n35. Whether or not the participant receives the Disability Support Pension under the Social\\n\\nSecurity Act 1991 and no matter the participant’s age, any board must not exceed a maximum amount (see Table 2) that is:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\n50 per cent of maximum basic rate of the Disability Support Pension payable for a person who is not under 21 and is a member of a couple (not separated due to illness);\\n\\n(ii) Plus: 100 per cent of the maximum rate of the Energy Supplement payable for a person\\n\\nwho is not under 21 and is a member of a couple (not separated due to illness).\\n\\nTable 2: Fortnightly Maximum Board\\n\\nPeriod\\n\\nSingle\\n\\nMember of a Couple (Each)\\n\\n20 March 2023 to 19 September 2023\\n\\n$499.85\\n\\n$376.75\\n\\n20 September 2022 to 19 March 2023\\n\\n$482.50\\n\\n$363.70\\n\\n36. Any board charged at the maximum amount must include at least:\\n\\n(i) Meals and consumables\\n\\n(ii) Utilities that would ordinarily be paid by occupants\\n\\n(iii) Access to whitegoods and laundry facilities\\n\\n(iv) Furniture and furnishings in the common areas\\n\\n37. If a Provider charges a participant board for any goods or services, the Provider must allow the participant to obtain those goods or services from a source other than the Provider and not pay board if the participant chooses to do so. A Provider must not disadvantage a participant if the participant chooses to obtain goods or services from a source other than the Provider.\\n\\n11\\n\\nSteps to Calculate the SDA Price for a Dwelling\\n\\n38. The SDA price limit is expressed as an annual amount.\\n\\n39. The calculation of the SDA price limit can be divided into a number of steps, as follows:\\n\\nStep 1: Determine the Base Price:\\n\\nStep 1A: Determine whether the dwelling is a post-2023 New Build, a pre-2023 New Build,\\n\\nExisting Stock or Legacy Stock\\n\\nStep 1B: Identify the Building Type\\n\\nStep 1C: Identify the Design Category\\n\\nStep 1D: Identify if there is a room for On-Site Overnight Assistance\\n\\nStep 1E: Identify if there is an additional breakout room (Robust only)\\n\\nStep 1F: Identify if the Dwelling has Fire Sprinklers\\n\\nStep 1G: Identify if GST input tax credits have been claimed\\n\\nStep 1H: Determine the Base Price\\n\\nStep 2: Identify the Location Factor\\n\\nStep 3: Calculate the SDA Price\\n\\nStep 4: Calculate the SDA Price (shared living arrangements)\\n\\nStep 1A: Determine whether the dwelling is a post-2023 New Build, a pre-2023 New Build, Existing Stock or Legacy Stock\\n\\n40. Different SDA price limits apply depending on whether the dwelling used to provide SDA is\\n\\nclassified as a New Build, Existing Stock or Legacy Stock.\\n\\n41. If the dwelling is a New Build, then different SDA price limits apply depending on whether the\\n\\ndwelling was:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nFirst enrolled as a new Build on or after 1 July 2023 (“a post 2023-New Build”); or\\n\\n(ii) First enrolled as a new Build before 1 July 2023 (“a pre-2023 New Build”).\\n\\n42. If a dwelling does not meet the requirements to be either a New Build, Existing Stock or\\n\\nLegacy Stock, the dwelling cannot be enrolled or receive SDA payments.\\n\\n43. Providers must ensure that a dwelling is correctly enrolled. All dwellings that are enrolled must meet the requirements of the SDA type for which the dwelling is enrolled and for which SDA payment is claimed.\\n\\n44. The definitions for New Build, Existing Stock and Legacy Stock are set out in the SDA Rules.\\n\\nDefinitions are summarised in Table 3 below.\\n\\nTable 3: Definitions of New Build, Existing Stock and Legacy Stock\\n\\nType\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nNew Build\\n\\nA dwelling is a New Build if it meets all of the following five conditions: 1) either: a) b)\\n\\nit was issued its first certificate of occupancy (or equivalent) on or after 1 April 2016; or it has been renovated or refurbished and issued with a certificate of occupancy (or equivalent) after 1 April 2016, and: i)\\n\\nbecause of the renovation or refurbishment, the dwelling meets the Minimum Requirements for a Design Category other than Basic design set out at Step 2B below; and\\n\\n12\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation 2023-24\\n\\nType\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nii)\\n\\nthe cost of the refurbishment is equal to or greater than the amount set out in Appendix G – Minimum Refurbishment Costs for New Builds ($2023-24); and\\n\\n2) either: a) b)\\n\\nit is enrolled to house five or fewer long-term residents (excluding support staff); or it is the home of a participant who intends to provide SDA to themselves (as a registered provider) and to reside there with the participant’s spouse or de facto partner and children; and\\n\\n3) all its shared areas, and any bedrooms for use by SDA-eligible participants comply with the\\n\\nMinimum Requirements for a Design Category other than Basic design set out at Step 2B below; it does not breach the density restrictions for New Builds in s 31 of the SDA Rules. The density restrictions apply when there are multiple dwellings on a single parcel of land; and fewer than 20 years have elapsed from the date the certificate of occupancy (or equivalent) in paragraph 1 of the Definition of New Build above was issued. When 20 years have elapsed from the date of the certificate of occupancy (or equivalent) the enrolment will convert to Existing Stock.\\n\\n4)\\n\\n5)\\n\\nExisting Stock\\n\\nA dwelling is Existing Stock if it meets all of the following six conditions: 1)\\n\\nit does not have a certificate of occupancy for a New Build (described in paragraph 1 of the definition of New Builds above); and it is enrolled to house five or fewer long-term residents (excluding support staff); and it has been, at some time between 1 July 2013 and 1 December 2016, primarily used as accommodation for people with disability who have an extreme functional impairment or very high support needs; and it is not an aged care, health care or other facility that is not specifically intended for use as disability accommodation; and it housed at least one resident who received disability related supported accommodation (or equivalent) payments from a State, Territory or Commonwealth Government at some time between 1 July 2013 and 1 December 2016; and\\n\\n2) 3)\\n\\n4)\\n\\n5)\\n\\n6) all its shared areas and any bedrooms for use by SDA-eligible participants comply, or substantially\\n\\ncomply, with the Minimum Requirements for any of the Design Categories set out at Step 2B below.\\n\\nA dwelling is also Existing Stock if it meets all of the following three conditions: 1)\\n\\nit does not have a certificate of occupancy for a New Build (described in paragraph 1 of the definition of New Builds above); and it is the home of a participant who intends to provide SDA to themselves (as a registered provider) and to reside there with the participant’s spouse or de facto partner and children; and 3) all its shared areas, and any bedrooms for use by SDA-eligible participants comply with the\\n\\n2)\\n\\nMinimum Requirements for a Design Category other than Basic design set out at Step 2B below.\\n\\nLegacy Stock\\n\\nA dwelling is Legacy Stock if it meets all of the following six conditions: 1)\\n\\nit does not have a certificate of occupancy for a New Build (described in paragraph 1 of the definition of New Builds above); and it is enrolled to house more than five long-term residents (excluding support staff); and it has been, at some time between 1 July 2013 and 1 December 2016, primarily used as accommodation for people with disability who have an extreme functional impairment or very high support needs; and it housed at least one resident who received disability related supported accommodation (or equivalent) payments from a State, Territory or Commonwealth Government at some time between 1 July 2013 and 1 December 2016; and it is not an aged care, health care or other facility that is not specifically intended for use as disability accommodation; and\\n\\n2) 3)\\n\\n4)\\n\\n5)\\n\\n6) all its shared areas, and any bedrooms for use by SDA-eligible participants comply, or substantially comply, with the Minimum Requirements for any of the Design Categories set out at Step 2B below.\\n\\nStep 1B: Identify the Building Type\\n\\n45. Dwellings are enrolled according to the Building Type specified by the registered provider. The SDA price limit that applies for the dwelling depends on the Building Type under which the dwelling is enrolled.\\n\\n46. Providers must ensure that a dwelling is correctly enrolled and claims for payment are\\n\\ncorrectly made. If a dwelling does not meet the requirements of the Building Type for which the\\n\\n13\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation 2023-24\\n\\ndwelling is enrolled and for which SDA is claimed, SDA payments cannot be paid for the dwelling and the enrolment will be cancelled.\\n\\n47. Registered providers are required to notify the NDIA within 5 working days if there is a change in the dwelling’s Building Type or if the Building Type is likely to change, as per s 29 of the SDA Rules.\\n\\n48. Schedule 1 to the SDA Rules provide descriptions in relation to five Building Types. This NDIS\\n\\nPricing Arrangements for SDA provides more detail in relation to some of those descriptions. SDA prices differ depending on the number of residents and number of bedrooms. An On-site Overnight Assistance (OOA) room is not a bedroom (see Step 2C).\\n\\n49. The number of residents for the purposes of calculating the base price includes both\\n\\nparticipants (who may or may not have SDA in their plans) and any other residents being accommodated at the dwelling, assuming one person per bedroom.\\n\\n(i) When a bedroom within a dwelling is shared then the base price is modified as set out in\\n\\nAppendix H – Shared living arrangements.\\n\\n50. The complete list of Building Types for which there are separate SDA prices is as follows:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nApartment, 1 bedroom, 1 resident\\n\\n(ii) Apartment, 2 bedrooms, 1 resident\\n\\n(iii) Apartment, 2 bedrooms, 2 residents\\n\\n(iv) Apartment, 3 bedrooms, 2 residents\\n\\n(v) Villa/duplex/townhouse, 1 resident\\n\\n(vi) Villa/duplex/townhouse, 2 residents\\n\\n(vii) Villa/duplex/townhouse, 3 residents\\n\\n(viii) House, 2 residents\\n\\n(ix) House, 3 residents\\n\\n(x) Group Home, 4 residents\\n\\n(xi) Group Home, 5 residents\\n\\n(xii) Legacy Stock, 6+ residents.\\n\\nRequired elements of all Building Types\\n\\n51. Dwellings of all Building Types must, as a minimum, contain all of the following elements:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\na kitchen,\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nbathroom,\\n\\n(iii)\\n\\nliving/dining area,\\n\\n(iv) entrance/exit, and\\n\\n(v)\\n\\nat least one bedroom.\\n\\n52. Dwellings that do not contain each of these elements cannot be enrolled as an SDA or must\\n\\nbe enrolled as part of a larger Building Type. Dwellings may contain more than one of each of the required elements.\\n\\n14\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation 2023-24\\n\\nDefinition of Building Types\\n\\n53. Table 4 sets out the definitions of each Building Type. The definitions provide further detail on\\n\\nthe descriptions contained in the SDA Rules.\\n\\nTable 4: Definitions of the Building Types\\n\\nBuilding Type Definition\\n\\nBuilding Code of Australia classification\\n\\nApartments\\n\\nClass 2\\n\\nApartments are self-contained units occupying only part of a larger\\n\\nresidential building.\\n\\nApartments are typically built above or below another dwelling. Self- contained dwellings that are separated from other dwellings by walls alone are not apartments but are likely to be a villa, duplex or townhouse.\\n\\nVillas, Duplexes and Townhouses\\n\\nClass 1(a)(ii), Class 3, or Class 1(a)(i)\\n\\nVillas, duplexes and townhouses are dwellings for one, two or three\\n\\nresidents.\\n\\nVillas, duplexes and townhouses are generally separate but semi-\\n\\nattached properties within a single land title or strata titled area.\\n\\nDwellings will be separated by a fire-resisting wall (although fire\\n\\nresistance is not required for Existing Stock).\\n\\nEach villa, duplex or townhouse must have a separate and reasonably accessible entry to/exit from the property, and participants must not be able to internally travel between dwellings. That is, participants must be required to exit one dwelling in order to enter another. Restricted internal access between dwellings may be provided for support staff only.\\n\\nVillas, duplexes and townhouses may also be ancillary dwellings that are located on the same parcel of land as another dwelling (e.g. fully self-contained ‘granny flats’).\\n\\nHouses\\n\\nClass 1(a)(i), Class 1(b)(i), or Class 3\\n\\nHouses are detached low-rise dwellings with garden or courtyard\\n\\nareas.\\n\\nTo be a house (rather than a villa/duplex/townhouse) the dwelling\\n\\nmust be located on a clearly separated land area (e.g. separated by a fence, hedge or other form of delineation that is in keeping with the character of the neighbourhood).\\n\\n\\n\\nIt must not share a wall, roof, entry area, driveway, car parking or outdoor area with any dwelling other than an ancillary Villa/Townhouse/Duplex with no more than one resident.\\n\\nA house is not to have more than two ancillary\\n\\nVilla/Duplex/Townhouses, otherwise the primary dwelling is likely to be considered a Villa/Townhouse/Duplex.\\n\\nEach house must have a land area that is proportional with the number of residents and keeps with similar properties in the neighbourhood.\\n\\nGroup Homes\\n\\nClass 1(b)(i), or Class 3\\n\\nGroup Homes are distinguished from other houses by the larger\\n\\nnumber of residents (four or five long term residents).\\n\\nStep 1C: Identify the Design Category\\n\\n54. Dwellings are also enrolled according to the Design Category specified by the registered\\n\\nprovider when enrolling the dwelling. The SDA price limit that applies for the dwelling depends on the Design Category under which the dwelling is enrolled.\\n\\n55. Providers must ensure that a dwelling is correctly enrolled and claims for payment are\\n\\ncorrectly made. If a dwelling does not meet the requirements of the Design Category for which the dwelling is enrolled and for which SDA payment is claimed, SDA payments cannot be paid for the dwelling and the enrolment will be cancelled.\\n\\n15\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation 2023-24\\n\\n56. Registered providers are required to notify the NDIA within five working days if there is a\\n\\nchange in the dwelling’s Design Category or if the Design Category is likely to change, as per s 29 of the SDA Rules.\\n\\n57. The SDA prices are based on five broad categories of SDA design which are set out in the\\n\\nSDA Rules. The five Design Categories are:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nBasic,\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nImproved Liveability,\\n\\n(iii) Fully Accessible,\\n\\n(iv) Robust, and\\n\\n(v) High Physical Support.\\n\\nMinimum Design Requirements for Existing and Legacy Stock\\n\\n58. In addition to the detailed description of each Building Type, this Pricing Arrangement also\\n\\nsets out the Minimum Requirements for each Design Category other than Basic designs.\\n\\n59. Some of the Minimum Requirements are based on the ‘Silver’ or ‘Platinum’ level housing designs set out in the Livable Housing Design Guidelines (fourth edition) Australia.\\n\\n60. For New Builds, all shared areas and any bedrooms for use by SDA-eligible participants must\\n\\ncomply with the Minimum Requirements set out below.\\n\\n61. For Existing Stock, there must be substantial compliance with the Minimum Requirements.\\n\\nSubstantial compliance means compliance in all but a few non-critical respects.\\n\\nTable 5: Description of Minimum Design Category Requirements\\n\\nDesign Category\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nMinimum Requirements\\n\\nBasic\\n\\nHousing without specialist design features but with a location or other features that cater for the needs of people with disability and assist with the delivery of support services.\\n\\nThe Basic design category only applies for Existing Stock or Legacy Stock and cannot be included in a participant’s plan except if the participant already lives in Basic design SDA, or where a participant chooses to reside in Basic design SDA (section 15 SDA Rules).\\n\\nImproved Liveability\\n\\nHousing that has been designed to improve ‘liveability’ by incorporating a reasonable level of physical access and enhanced provision for people with sensory, intellectual or cognitive impairment.\\n\\nLiveable Housing Australia ‘Silver’ level.\\n\\nThe designed environment responds to the needs of participants through improved physical access and enhanced provision for participants with sensory, intellectual or cognitive impairment. For example, Improved Liveability dwellings should include one or more additional design features such as the below depending on the needs of the participants: luminance contrasts; improved wayfinding; and/or lines of sight.\\n\\nFully Accessible\\n\\nHousing that has been designed to incorporate a high level of physical access provision for people with significant physical impairment.\\n\\nLiveable Housing Australia ‘Platinum’ level.\\n\\nExternal doors and external outdoor private areas to be accessible by\\n\\nwheelchair.\\n\\nBathroom vanity/hand basin to be accessible in seated or standing\\n\\nposition.\\n\\nPower supply to doors and windows (blinds), for retrofit of automation\\n\\nas necessary.\\n\\nConsideration must be given to whether it is appropriate for the kitchen\\n\\nsink, cooktop, meal preparation bench area and key appliances (dishwasher, oven, microwave oven and laundry appliances) to be accessible in seated or standing position.\\n\\n16\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation 2023-24\\n\\nDesign Category\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nMinimum Requirements\\n\\nRobust\\n\\nHousing that has been designed to incorporate a high level of physical access provision and be very resilient, while reducing the likelihood of reactive maintenance and reducing the risk to the participant and the community.\\n\\nLiveable Housing Australia ‘Silver’ level.\\n\\nResilient but inconspicuous materials that can withstand heavy use and minimises the risk of injury and neighbourhood disturbance including: – high impact wall lining, fittings and fixtures (e.g. blinds, door\\n\\nhandles);\\n\\n– secure windows, doors and external areas; – appropriate sound proofing if residents are likely to cause\\n\\nsignificant noise disturbances (if required must retro-fit in new builds if not previously installed at building stage); and laminated glass.\\n\\n–\\n\\nLayout with areas of leaving or retreat for staff and other residents to\\n\\navoid harm if required.\\n\\nConsideration must be given to providing adequate space and\\n\\nsafeguards throughout the property to accommodate the needs of residents with complex behaviours.\\n\\nHigh Physical Support\\n\\nHousing that has been designed to incorporate a high level of physical access provision for people with significant physical impairment and requiring very high levels of support.\\n\\nLiveable Housing Australia ‘Platinum’ level.\\n\\nExternal doors and external outdoor private areas to be accessible by\\n\\nwheelchair.\\n\\nBathroom vanity/hand basin to be accessible in seated or standing\\n\\nposition.\\n\\nPower supply to doors and windows (blinds), for retrofit of automation\\n\\nas necessary.\\n\\nConsideration must be given to whether it is appropriate for the kitchen\\n\\nsink, cooktop, meal preparation bench area and key appliances (dishwasher, oven, microwave oven and laundry appliances) to be accessible in seated or standing position.\\n\\nStructural provision for ceiling hoists.\\n\\nAssistive technology ready.\\n\\nHeating/cooling and household communication technology (e.g. video\\n\\nor intercom systems) appropriate for the needs of residents.\\n\\nEmergency power solutions to cater for a minimum two hour outage\\n\\nwhere the welfare of participant(s) is at risk.\\n\\nDoors with 950mm minimum clear opening width to all habitable\\n\\nrooms.\\n\\nMinimum Design Requirements for New Build and New Build (Refurbished)\\n\\n62. In October 2019, the NDIA published the SDA Design Standard. The Design Standard set out detailed design requirements that will be incorporated into newly built SDA that are seeking enrolment under the NDIS.\\n\\n63. Compliance with the Design Standard is mandatory from 1 July 2021, and demonstrates by the submission of certification from an accredited SDA assessor attached to each dwelling enrolment application.\\n\\n64. The NDIA will accept certification from accredited SDA assessors against the Design Standard\\n\\nfrom 1 July 2020, for those SDA providers who wish to shift to the incoming Design Standard and provide certification early. Applications received attaching Design Standard certification will meet the minimum requirements for SDA.\\n\\n65. For more information about the SDA Design Standard and SDA assessors, please visit the\\n\\nNDIS website.\\n\\n17\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation 2023-24\\n\\nStep 1D: Identify if there is a room for On-Site Overnight Assistance\\n\\n66. The On-site Overnight Assistance (OOA) amount is only paid when an additional room is used by support staff who provide support services overnight to participants living in the same dwelling that contains the OOA room or in a near-by dwelling.\\n\\n67. The form of OOA varies between Building Type and the amount of the OOA assistance\\n\\npayment made in relation to this room, as a consequence, may depend on whether access to the OOA is shared between multiple dwellings.\\n\\n68. Table 6 describes the OOA and when OOA is payable.\\n\\nTable 6: Description of OOA by Building Type & when OOA is payable\\n\\nBuilding Type\\n\\nDescription of OOA\\n\\nWhen OOA is payable\\n\\nApartment\\n\\nThe OOA must be a separate apartment in the same apartment complex as the SDA apartment.\\n\\nA maximum of 10 SDA apartments. The OOA amount for one separate OOA apartment is payable for a maximum of 10 SDA apartments.\\n\\nThe OOA amount is not paid when the OOA is an additional room in an SDA apartment.\\n\\nNo OOA amount is payable once the OOA amount has been added for 10 SDA apartments.\\n\\nOther building types\\n\\nAn additional room inside or adjoining the\\n\\nWhile the OOA may be shared between\\n\\ndwelling(s).\\n\\nmultiple dwellings, it can only be claimed against one dwelling.\\n\\nStep 1E: Identify if there is an additional breakout room (Robust only)\\n\\n69. Only dwellings in the Robust Design Category can have an additional breakout room.\\n\\n70. Only dwellings with more than one bedroom can have an additional breakout room.\\n\\n71. Apartments cannot have an additional breakout room.\\n\\n72. A breakout room is a separate room designed to respond to the individual disability related\\n\\nneeds of the participant. It is not a study or living/dining area but is intended to be dedicated and used to enhance learning, exploration or positively impact mood. These rooms would, therefore, be expected to make use of activities, equipment, sound and lighting in ways that are appropriate to the current resident(s).\\n\\n73. Some dwellings may have both an OOA and a breakout room.\\n\\nStep 1F: Identify if the Dwelling has Fire Sprinklers\\n\\n74. A different SDA price limit applies when fire sprinklers have been installed throughout the SDA\\n\\ndwelling and they comply with all relevant building codes and laws, including requirements in relation to installation, testing and maintenance.\\n\\nStep 1G: Identify if GST input tax credits have been claimed\\n\\n75. This step only applies to post-2023 New Builds.\\n\\n76. For post-2023 New Builds, a different SDA price limit applies depending on whether:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nThe owner of the dwelling either did not pay GST on the construction costs, or on the purchase price, of the dwelling, or the owner of the dwelling paid GST on the construction costs, or on the purchase price, of the dwelling and has claimed input tax credits in respect of those GST payments; or\\n\\n18\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation 2023-24\\n\\n(ii) The owner of the dwelling paid GST on the construction costs, or on the purchase price, of the dwelling and has not claimed input tax credits in respect of those GST payments.\\n\\nStep 1H: Determine the Base Price Limit\\n\\n77. The Base Price Limits for each type of dwelling are set out in:\\n\\n(i) Appendix A – Base Price Limits for Post-2023 New Builds\\n\\n(ii) Appendix B – Base Price Limits for Pre-2023 New Builds\\n\\n(iii) Appendix C – Base Price Limits for Existing Stock\\n\\n(iv) Appendix D – Base Price Limits for Legacy Stock\\n\\n78. In general, SDA Legacy properties with 11 or more residents are no longer eligible for SDA\\n\\npayments. Any exceptions to this rule are set out in Appendix D – Base Price Limits for Legacy Stock.\\n\\n79. For SDA Legacy properties with 6 to 10 residents, SDA payments will cease after the end of\\n\\nthe immediate ten-year period after the property’s location transitioned into the NDIS.\\n\\nStep 2: Identify the Location Factor\\n\\n80. The Location Factors applied in SDA pricing are based on Australian Bureau of Statistics\\n\\n(ABS) Statistical Area 4 regions from 2021. See: ABS Statistical Area 4.\\n\\n81. To derive an SDA price limit for a particular dwelling, the Base Price is multiplied by the\\n\\nLocation Factor relevant to the property’s location and Building Type.\\n\\n82. The Location Factors are set out in:\\n\\n(i) Appendix E – Location Factors for New Builds\\n\\n(ii) Appendix F – Location Factors for Existing and Legacy Stock.\\n\\nStep 3: Calculate the SDA Price Limit\\n\\n83. To calculate the annual SDA price limit for a dwelling, the annual Base Price Limit per\\n\\nparticipant is multiplied by the relevant Location Factor. This calculation is shown in the formula below:\\n\\nAnnual SDA price limit\\n\\n=\\n\\nAnnual Base Price x Location Factor\\n\\nStep 4: Calculate the SDA Price (shared living arrangements)\\n\\n84. If two people are sharing a bedroom in an enrolled dwelling or if one or more SDA-eligible\\n\\nparticipants are sharing an enrolled dwelling with one or more people who are not SDA-eligible participants then the SDA price limit is adjusted as set out in Appendix H – Shared living arrangements.\\n\\n19\\n\\nAppendix A – Base Price Limits for Post-2023 New Builds\\n\\nTable 7: Annual Base

Providers who deliver other types of group- based supports should not rely on this guidance.\\n\\nThe contents are not intended to replicate or replace the information contained in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nAccording to the NDIS Act (2013), key objectives of the NDIS are to “…support the independence and social and economic participation of people with disability, maximise a person’s inclusion in the community, and to facilitate greater community inclusion of people with disability\\n\\nThe NDIA recently conducted research on social inclusion and community access, which\\n\\ncan be found on the NDIS website: Social inclusion and community access research | NDIS. As part of this research, participants told us that community participation gave them:\\n\\nA sense of belonging and connection.\\n\\nDeeper relationships with friends and family.\\n\\nLarger social networks and reduced isolation.\\n\\nIncreased confidence, self-efficacy, and safety.\\n\\n\\n\\nIncreased opportunities for further community participation, employment or study.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe NDIA recognises that providers delivering social and community participation supports play a significant role in enabling participants to share in these benefits.\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n4\\n\\nNew group-based supports pricing\\n\\nBoth the new pricing arrangement (introduced July 2020) and the transitional pricing arrangement are based on the Disability Support Worker (DSW) Cost Model. Figure 1 is a visual comparison of the two arrangements, showing the indicative cost elements for each approach.\\n\\nThe transitional pricing is a maximum rate per hour per participant that includes a standard provision for Non-Face-to-Face (NF2F) support, as well as centre capital costs (if relevant).\\n\\nThe new pricing arrangement is a maximum rate per hour per group, centre capital costs (if relevant) are claimed separately, and NF2F costs are now negotiated to reflect the actual needs of participants and are also claimed separately.\\n\\nFIGURE 1 - COMPARISON OF PRICING ARRANGEMENTS\\n\\nThe new pricing arrangement also introduces Programs of Support (POS). The POS model allows providers and participants to agree on programs of activity up to 6 months which gives some increased certainty around the supports and participants attending which can mean more certainty around costs for both participants and providers.\\n\\nThis guidance was developed to complement the Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits (PAPL) which can be found on the NDIS website. We have developed this guidance based on questions and scenarios received since the new pricing\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n5\\n\\narrangement was introduced to help providers understand how the new pricing arrangement could be operationalised in different settings and contexts. For brevity, we have referred to ‘participant’ throughout this document, but where relevant, mean that to include families, carers, responsible person or nominees as well.\\n\\nIf any inconsistencies with the PAPL are identified in this guidance, the PAPL is the higher order document and must be complied with.\\n\\nDirect (Face-to-Face) Supports\\n\\nHow are staff costs covered if the pricing is per group and doesn’t consider staff to participant ratios?\\n\\nA core element of the Scheme is choice and control. Group-based social and community participation supports delivered in large groups can sometimes make it difficult to accommodate the preferences and interests of all people in the group.\\n\\nSome providers who have transitioned to the new pricing have told us that the shift to charging per group provided an incentive for them to think more closely about how they structure the programs they offer. They have worked with participants and nominees to ensure they have a good understanding of everyone’s interests and goals. Viewing the group-supports through the lens of smaller groups has allowed them to really target the support they offer to meet the real needs of these participants.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nA provider delivers group-based supports to 20 participants in their centre. These 20 participants are supported by 4 support workers, and participants are charged under the transitional pricing at the 1:5 weekday daytime standard rate.\\n\\nIf the provider continues to deliver support to these participants as one large group of 20 under the new pricing arrangement, they will experience a reduction in revenue that could threaten the financial viability of the future provision of the group support.\\n\\nInstead, the provider changes their service offering and splits the group into 4 groups, each with 5 participants supported by 1 support worker. Under the\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n6\\n\\nnew pricing arrangement, the hourly rate for group activities is divided by the number of participants in the group.\\n\\nA provider may choose to offer different activities within each group that are more targeted to the individual needs of the participants.\\n\\nDo direct support costs need to be apportioned equally amongst the participants, for example where participants in a group have different support needs?\\n\\nUnder the new pricing arrangement, the hourly rate for group activities is divided evenly by the number of participants in the group. There is no provision to apportion that rate differently amongst participants in the group.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nThree participants want to attend a group activity. One of the participants can be supported with the same worker ratio, however, has higher intensity support needs. This means the group must be supported by a more qualified worker.\\n\\nIn this case, assuming the participants have sufficient funding and agree, they should all be charged the higher intensity rate for the group-based supports. While this is slightly more than the standard intensity costs, it is more effective, both in terms of cost and social outcomes, than the alternative option of supporting the participant with higher intensity support needs individually with a more qualified worker, and the other participants as a group of two with one, less qualified worker.\\n\\nHow is a participant charged when they need 1:1 self-care during their group-based support?\\n\\nUltimately this is a commercial business decision for each provider.\\n\\nSome things providers should consider in making a decision include:\\n\\nWhether the activity is resourced and available to the participant for the full group-based support, regardless of 1:1 self-care needs (i.e., if the self-care takes 20 minutes instead of 30, is the participant able to re-join the group for that extra 10 minutes);\\n\\nConsidering the same scenario for the other participants, for example if a\\n\\nparticipant who can attend to self-care tasks unassisted spent 15 minutes in\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n7\\n\\nthe bathroom during a 4 hour activity, would it be a reasonable expectation to charge them 3 hours and 45 minutes of group time instead of 4 hours?\\n\\nWhichever approach is taken, it is expected that this is communicated clearly with the participant, including in the program of support agreement (where relevant) and that appropriate supporting documentation is retained as evidence of support delivery.\\n\\nNon-Face-to-Face Supports\\n\\nHow does non-face-to-face claiming work for group-based supports?\\n\\nUnder the new pricing arrangement, providers and participants have more flexibility to agree on non-face-to-face fees that reflect the cost of meeting the individual participant’s needs for a group-based support. They are claimed with the same line item as the relevant direct support; however, the non-face-to-face claim type is selected, differentiating it from the claim for the direct support. For more information on claiming, please see the “Using the myplace provider portal step by step guide” on the NDIS website.\\n\\nNon-face-to-face costs for group-based supports are different from the administrative and corporate overheads that are already built into the Disability Support Worker Cost Model. Any NF2F supports must be agreed with the Participant and in line with the Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\n\\nClaimable non-face-to-face costs are the indirect supports specifically required to deliver group-based supports to a participant. The NDIA has not published an exhaustive list of these, as we recognise that what is a reasonable NF2F support for one participant and activity may not be for another. Consider the following example:\\n\\nScenario\\n\\nA provider runs a cooking class as a group-based support activity. Could the time shopping for ingredients be claimable as a NF2F support?\\n\\nExample 1:\\n\\nThe participants goals are to increase their independent living skills so that they can move out of home in the next couple of years.\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n8\\n\\nThe provider estimates it will take 30 minutes to shop for ingredients. Even though this may limit the ability of the participants to cook some kinds of recipes, shopping for groceries as part of meal preparation is an independent living skill.\\n\\nThe provider and participant agree that participants will help shop for groceries as part of their face-to-face activity as it will better help them achieve their goals.\\n\\nIn this instance they are not likely to be appropriate NF2F costs.\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nThe participants goals are to socialise with their friends, some of whom attend the same centre for group activities for 2 hours each week.\\n\\nThe provider estimates it will take 30 minutes to shop for ingredients. If they do this as a F2F support, it may limit the ability of the participants to cook some kinds of recipes during their session and having the DSW shop for ingredients prior to the session is preferable.\\n\\nIn this instance, If the provider and participant agree, it may be appropriate to claim the cost for the shopping as a NF2F support, split between the participants who attend the group.\\n\\nHow are NF2F supports documented?\\n\\nDifferent types of NF2F costs may have different documentation requirements depending on what the NF2F cost is covering. For example, a cost shared across a group of participants could be documented with an addition to a group-roster, however a one off individual NF2F cost may need case notes or similar evidence to be retained.\\n\\nPlease visit the NDIS website at Getting paid | NDIS for more information about how to appropriately document NF2F supports for a particular support\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n9\\n\\nCentre Capital Costs\\n\\nWhat are centre capital costs?\\n\\nSome social and community participation supports are delivered in centres. These centres are different to typical community settings and are designed as accessible spaces for those with higher support needs.\\n\\nThe centre capital cost line item is an additional amount contributing to the costs of running and maintaining a centre.\\n\\nThis line item cannot be claimed when using the transitional pricing as the centre capital cost is already included in those prices. Details related to claiming centre capital costs are contained within the PAPL and providers are reminded they are required to acknowledge compliance with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its associated documents when submitting a payment request through the myplace Provider Portal.\\n\\nCentre capital costs, where relevant, can be claimed per hour per participant.\\n\\nClaiming when a group spends part of the time at our centre and part of the time out in the community?\\n\\nProviders can claim centre capital costs when the support is partially delivered in a centre if the centre is available for use for the duration of the group-based support activity.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nA group of participants attend a support each Friday that brings them together over a shared love of music. They meet in a centre which is designed to support participants with high support needs.\\n\\nThe local council is putting on a month-long series of free lunchtime concerts in the botanic gardens on Fridays.\\n\\nThe participants and provider decide that this a great opportunity to explore music in the community and arrange to attend the concerts which are a short walk away from the centre. This means they will be out of the centre for about 2 hours each Friday for that month. They are charged the centre\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n10\\n\\ncapital costs for the full 6 hours because the centre is available for them to use if needed.\\n\\nOn the day of the second concert, a thunderstorm is forecast, and the concert is cancelled so the group spend the full day in the centre and participate in other activities instead.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the centre needs to be genuinely available to participants who are charged the centre capital costs while not at the centre. Consider a scenario where a provider runs a centre that can safely accommodate 30 participants. If they support 50 participants and rotate groups in and out of the centre to meet capacity constraints, then the centre is not genuinely available for up to 20 of the 50 participants at any one time.\\n\\nCan centre capital costs be claimed for delivering a support at a community facility we have temporarily hired, such as a swimming pool?\\n\\nNo, centre capital costs cannot be claimed for temporary hire of facilities. Hiring a pool or other community facility isn’t incurring running and maintenance costs so isn’t intended to be covered by this line item.\\n\\nPrograms of Support\\n\\nWhat is a Program of Support?\\n\\nPrograms of Support can relate to any group-based support:\\n\\n\\n\\nin the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation Support Category, including group-based supports and Supports in Employment;\\n\\n\\n\\nin the Assistance in Shared Living Arrangements - Supported Independent Living section of the Assistance with Daily Life Support Category; and\\n\\n\\n\\nin any Capacity Building Support Category.\\n\\nThey are arrangements between a participant and provider that must include the length of the program, exit rules and intended outcomes.\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n11\\n\\nPrograms of Support encourage providers to offer group activities designed around and based on a participant’s goals and aspirations. It also gives more certainty for providers offering group-based supports.\\n\\nPrograms of Support:\\n\\nallow a provider to enter into an agreement with a participant for a Program of\\n\\nSupport for up to 6 months, particularly where the program focusses on achieving a specified outcome.\\n\\ncan simplify claiming arrangements.\\n\\nare not subject to the short notice cancellation rules so can help secure the\\n\\nviability of group activities and manage cancellation risk.\\n\\nThe NDIA recognises that Programs of Support might not be suitable for all providers, activities, or participants. They are not mandatory, and offering Programs of Support is a commercial business decision for each provider to make, considering the needs of their business and the people they support.\\n\\nWhether Group and Centre Based Activities are delivered under a Program of Support or not, they must comply with the Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\n\\nNote\\n\\nPrograms of Support previously had a maximum length of 12 weeks. This has been increased to 6 months in response to stakeholder feedback. While some participants and providers will welcome the option to move to longer Programs of Support, the NDIA reiterates that this is a maximum length and shorter Programs of Support can still be agreed if desired.\\n\\nCan 1:1 supports be included in a Program of Support?\\n\\nThe Group Activities line items on pages 59 and 60 of the PAPL (standard and high intensity) can be delivered to individuals or groups of participants. These line items can also be delivered as part of a program of support.\\n\\nNote:\\n\\nThis advice in this answer is applicable only for the group activities line items on page 59 and 60 of the PAPL and should not be applied to other support types and line items as they may have different requirements.\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n12\\n\\nIf delivering supports under a Program of Support, is a new Service Agreement required every 6 months?\\n\\nA Service Agreement is different to a Program of Support. A Service Agreement may refer to multiple Programs of Support, so a new Service Agreement is not necessarily needed every 6 months, however Programs of Support must not automatically roll over, and must be individually agreed.\\n\\nWhere a Service Agreement refers to multiple Programs of Support, before agreeing on each individual Program of Support under that Service Agreement, the provider and participant would discuss progress towards goals and what program opportunities they are interested in pursuing.\\n\\nWhat are the cancellation rules for a Program of Support?\\n\\nThe short notice cancellation rules don’t apply for Programs of Support. Under the PAPL, providers may claim for supports that a participant has agreed to attend, whether or not they actually do attend, unless a participant has given notice to exit the program.\\n\\nIt is important for providers to clearly communicate this to participants, including any expectations around payment during planned absences. If a participant notifies the provider in advance of a planned absence, the provider may need to adjust their service delivery.\\n\\nProviders are responsible for being upfront with terms of support, likewise, participants are also responsible for providing notice when exiting a Program of Support.\\n\\nWhat is the notice period to exit a Program of Support?\\n\\nThe notice period for a program of support is 2 weeks.\\n\\nIf a participant exits a Program of Support, can a provider change the amount they charge the remaining participants?\\n\\nThe PAPL does allow for providers and participants to agree on a new Program of Support at any time.\\n\\nHowever, this is a commercial business decision for the provider, and something that should be discussed with the participant both as part of the process to agree to a Program of Support, as well as in instances where this situation eventuates.\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n13\\n\\nGeneral Questions\\n\\nWill the transition period be extended again, and can we just keep using the transitional prices?\\n\\nThe new pricing arrangement was introduced in July 2020, and the transition period ends 31 December 2023. The Agency consulted with the sector on the new pricing and transition in 2022 and heard there were some opportunities to make improvements with some amendments to the PAPL and improved provide guidance. This final 6 month extension allows the NDIA to make those minor amendments, and to ensure all relevant stakeholders are appropriately supported during transition.\\n\\nProviders who require time to transition to the new pricing arrangements may continue using the previous ratio-based support items (referred to as transitional arrangements) until 31 December 2023.\\n\\nOnce a provider has transitioned to the new pricing, they can’t revert to the transitional pricing.\\n\\nAll providers must fully transition by 31 December 2023 and no further extension will be granted beyond this date.\\n\\nIs the NDIA adding more of an administrative focus to the Disability Support Worker role by introducing separate NF2F claiming?\\n\\nNon-face-to-face work to support the face-to-face delivery of supports is common among many support types. For group-based social and community participation supports, the newer pricing approach means that providers can now reflect the actual non-face-to-face effort expended for each group and/or participant.\\n\\nSome providers who have transitioned to the new pricing approach have told us that the expectations for their Disability Support Workers haven’t changed with the transition, but now those expectations are clearly reflected in things like their position descriptions and staff rosters.\\n\\nIt has also provided organisations and staff an opportunity to reflect on the NF2F component of their work, identify opportunities to try new, more effective or efficient ways of working, and to work with participants to ensure the NF2F supports being provided are meeting their needs.\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n14\\n\\nIs the newer pricing approach designed to reduce revenue available for group-based supports?\\n\\nThe maximum hourly rates for group-based supports under the transitional pricing approach included a provision for NF2F support. The NDIA recognises that each participant and provider are different, and a standard one-size-fits-all approach for the provision of NF2F costs did not provide enough opportunity to truly reflect the real costs of meeting the needs of participants.\\n\\nCharging NF2F fees in line with NF2F effort could mean that providers agree with individual participants to charge less, the same or more. Separating the costs out is about giving providers flexibility in how they deliver supports and position themselves in the market, not reducing revenue.\\n\\nSome providers who have transitioned to the newer pricing approach have told us that the transition provided an opportunity to deep dive into their financials and even tie this knowledge into their EBA negotiations. Some also told us that it provided an opportunity for change and to move away from tasks being undertaken simply because that is how they had always done them. Considering all the cost elements with a critical eye allowed them to refine their operations to better meet the needs of their participants, staff and business in general.\\n\\nSeparating out NF2F costs is an administrative burden and may be challenging for participants to understand. Are there any real benefits to participants?\\n\\nWhile providers who have transitioned did acknowledge it took effort to adapt to the new pricing approach, some providers told us that that they have seen benefits, and the range of benefits continues to grow the longer they have been operating under the new pricing approach.\\n\\nUnder the transitional pricing approach, providers told us it was not always viable to include some participants with more complex needs into some group-supports or activities. Under the newer pricing approach, some providers through negotiation with participants, have been able to fund sufficient NF2F effort to adapt group- support offerings to accommodate a wider range of support needs, including more complex support needs. The ability to negotiate actual costs for individual needs can increase inclusion and ensure those with the highest support needs are receiving the support they require to participant in social and community activities.\\n\\nWe encourage you to think big around the new pricing and consider how it might enable your business to better support participants.\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n15\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nFarhana attends a group program at a centre. She attends for 2 hours a week, with 2 other participants.\\u202fThey all have an interest in bikes and bike riding, and as a group, have been learning how to maintain bikes with their support worker, Sunny.\\n\\nFarhana typically pays for the 2 hours of face-to-face support, 2 hours of centre capital costs, and what works out to be about 10 minutes’ worth of agreed NF2F support.\\n\\nSunny notices a local bike riding club is having an open day. The group discuss the club and open day over a few sessions. As the open day approaches, Farhana decides she would like to attend but doesn’t feel confident approaching the club independently.\\n\\nThe provider and Farhana agree for Sunny to spend up to an hour working with the club to plan for Farhana to attend the open day.\\n\\nAfter 45 minutes of work outside of the group support session, Sunny and the club have identified a safe and meaningful way for Farhana to attend the open day. That week, in addition to her typical costs for the group-based support, Farhana pays an additional NF2F amount to cover the extra 45 minutes that Sunny worked with the bike club.\\n\\nFarhana enjoys the open day and finds the club a friendly and supportive place to be. She is looking forward to attending more club events. The other participants are excited to hear about their experience and are even thinking about checking out the next open day themselves.\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n16\\n\\nWill providers need to upgrade systems to transition to the new pricing approach?\\n\\nThe NDIA is not able to advise on systems, as this is a commercial business decision for each provider. However, during our consultations, we have heard that some providers who have transitioned have done so with existing systems, and some have used this as an opportunity to roll out new systems.\\n\\nWhat transition may mean for you will be impacted by how you apply the pricing approach and the systems you already have in place.\\n\\nHas an outcomes framework for group-based social and community participation supports been developed?\\n\\nA central pillar of the NDIS is choice and control for participants. The NDIA would like to see participants choosing their supports for social and community participation from a vibrant and diverse market.\\n\\nParticipants have shared with the NDIA that community participation gave them:\\n\\na sense of belonging and connection. • a way to deepen relationships with friends and family. • • greater confidence. • a way to increase opportunities for further community participation, employment or\\n\\nlarger social networks and reduced isolation.\\n\\nstudy.\\n\\nThe NDIA currently collects broad data on participant outcomes for the social and community participation domain through the Short Form Outcomes Framework and some other measures including social inclusion and community access research. The NDIA is currently working on a number of evaluation projects, and some of these might help to identify other indicators that could demonstrate outcomes for NDIS funded group-based social and community participation supports.\\n\\nFindings from these evaluations combined with extensive consultation across a range of stakeholder groups over 2023 and into 2024 will help the NDIA identify whether a formal, standalone outcomes framework for group-based social and community participation support is required.\\n\\nOn a more individual level, elements of the new pricing approach such as Program of Supports, and even the separate Non-Face-to-Face claiming, is expected to encourage goals and outcomes to feature more broadly in the conversations that providers, participants, and the NDIA have around group-based supports. Acknowledging and sharing outcomes as part of the general conversation provides an opportunity for participants to discover new interests and aspirations, and to spark innovative thinking for providers.\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n17\\n\\nWhat role do providers have in ensuring participants have sufficient funding in their plans?\\n\\nThe NDIA makes planning decisions based on legislative requirements, including a participant’s support needs and their goals. Where support for social and community participation is reasonable and necessary, and a participant would like to be supported in a group setting, funding will be provided. Providers can then work with participants to agree a program of support or explore what supports can be purchased within their budget.\\n\\nProviders can provide participants with information about their supports, how this assists them to meet their goals and any specific support needs, which a participant may take to their planning conversation.\\n\\nClear communication, consistent billing practices and using Program of Support are the best ways providers can help ensure that participants have sufficient funding in their plans.\\n\\nHow do participant goals impact group-based social and community participation supports?\\n\\nSocial and recreation supports are key to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) achieving its objective to support people with a disability to achieve independence, social and economic participation.\\n\\nParticipant goals are a key feature of the NDIS and are referenced throughout the NDIS Act (2013). Goals are important because they are developed by participants expressing their personal desires about what they want to do and achieve.\\n\\nWhen we fund social and recreation supports we need to know that these supports will help a participant to pursue the goals in their plan. What we consider when funding supports is further explained here Reasonable and necessary supports | NDIS and Social and recreation support | NDIS.\\n\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the goals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes Framework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and overall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which help participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners explore where supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required.\\n\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must contribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan It is important providers work closely with participant’s and their families and carers to understand the participant’s goals for social and community participation and deliver supports that will assist a participant to achieve their goals.\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n18\\n\\nEvery participant is different, but it’s important that you find ways to understand the participant’s goals, what their interests are and how the supports you offer can help them to achieve their goals. Providers should keep in mind that it’s up to a participant whether or not they share a copy of their plan.\\n\\nThe changes to group-based pricing is intended to enable providers and participants to agree on the direct and non-face to face supports provided and claim for these as they are provided based on the individual needs of each participant.\\n\\nInvesting in understanding participants and their goals will help you deliver supports that are individualised and outcomes focused. We encourage providers to identify opportunities for new and innovative ways to support participants to achieve their goals and outcomes, which is facilitated through the changes to the pricing arrangements which better reflect the individual costs for each participant.\\n\\nWill there be more support for transition?\\n\\nWe are currently testing resources for all stakeholders, including participants and their families and carers, as well as intermediaries like plan managers and support coordinators.\\n\\nWe will also regularly update providers with answers to any common questions that arise.\\n\\nIf you need more support, in the first instance we encourage you to seek further information through your existing NDIA contact channels.\\n\\nYou can also email the transition team directly at group.supports.transition@ndis.gov.au.\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nGroup-Based Supports – Pricing Transition\\n\\n19', metadata={'source': '../../data/ndis/PB Group-Based Supports Transition Guidance.pdf'}), Document(page_content=\"National Disability Insurance Scheme\\n\\nAssistive Technology, Home Modifications and Consumables Code Guide 2023-24\\n\\nValid from: 1 July 2023 Version 1.0 (Released 16 June 2023)\\n\\nCopyright\\n\\n© National Disability Insurance Agency 2023\\n\\nUse of National Disability Insurance Agency copyright material\\n\\nThe material in this document with the exception of logos, trademarks, third party material and other content as specified is licensed under Creative Commons CC NC licence, version 4.0.

Guide 2023-24 Version 1.0\\n\\nPage 4 of 35\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 (NDIS Act) states that a funded support must represent “value for money” in that the costs of the support are reasonable, relative to both the benefits achieved and the cost of alternative support.\\n\\nDetermining whether a support is reasonable and necessary for an individual participant will be guided by the NDIS Act (2013), the associated NDIS Rules, and the National Disability Insurance Agency’s (NDIA) Operational Guidelines. These can be found on the NDIA website.\\n\\nThis Guide is not a comprehensive list of all Assistive Technology (AT) supports that may be provided as reasonable and necessary under the NDIS, but lists the most commonly used supports to assist providers to claim payments using a “best-fit” approach, and to assist participants with consistent terminology for AT comparison.\\n\\nAs with other support categories, AT has many specific supports and services that are recognised in the NDIS payment system, and these are referred to as ‘line items’. A comprehensive listing of AT support line items is kept up to date in a separate file (csv format) on the NDIS website.\\n\\nAll providers from each state and territory can now register with the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission.\\n\\nSupport Purpose\\n\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant budgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support budgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or capacity building supports).\\n\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\n\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this support purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and skills.\\n\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\n\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the goals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes Framework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and overall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which help participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners explore where supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These domains are:\\n\\n1. Daily Living\\n\\n5. Work\\n\\n2. Home\\n\\n6. Social and Community Participation\\n\\n3. Health and Wellbeing\\n\\n7. Relationships\\n\\n4. Lifelong Learning\\n\\n8. Choice and Control\\n\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must contribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan. Support purpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\n\\nNDIS ATHM and Consumables Code Guide 2023-24 Version 1.0\\n\\nPage 5 of 35\\n\\ncategories. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and providers to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant’s goals.\\n\\nThe following table shows the links between support purpose types, domains in the Outcomes Framework and support categories.\\n\\nSUPPORT CATEGORY\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nOUTCOME DOMAIN\\n\\nCORE\\n\\nDaily Living\\n\\n01 Assistance with Daily Life\\n\\nDaily Living\\n\\n02 Transport\\n\\nDaily Living\\n\\n03 Consumables\\n\\nSocial and Community Participation\\n\\n04 Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation\\n\\nWork\\n\\n04 Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation\\n\\nCAPITAL\\n\\nDaily Living\\n\\n05 Assistive Technology\\n\\nHome\\n\\n06 Home Modifications and Specialised Disability Accommodation\\n\\n(SDA)\\n\\nCAPACITY\\n\\nChoice and Control\\n\\n07 Support Coordination\\n\\nBUILDING\\n\\nHome\\n\\n08 Improved Living Arrangements\\n\\nSocial and Community Participation\\n\\n09 Increased Social and Community Participation\\n\\nWork\\n\\n10 Finding and Keeping a Job\\n\\nRelationships\\n\\n11 Improved Relationships\\n\\nHealth and Wellbeing\\n\\n12 Improved Health and Wellbeing\\n\\nLifelong Learning\\n\\n13 Improved Learning\\n\\nChoice and Control\\n\\n14 Improved Life Choices\\n\\nDaily Living\\n\\n15 Improved Daily Living Skills\\n\\nParticipant budgets are allocated according to Support Purpose\\n\\nSupports in participant plans are categorised according to the three Support Purposes identified earlier.\\n\\nParticipant budgets for these Capital supports, such as AT, are primarily for specific item types or for repair/maintenance of AT as identified in the participant’s plan. Most higher cost items (over $15,000) are ‘quotable’, which means that providers must negotiate a price in a Service Agreement with a participant and provide a written quote for that supply. Associated supports can include assessments associated with supply of the AT device, as well as delivery, set-up, and adjustment, as well as ongoing maintenance/repair costs.\\n\\nTypically, AT that is more complex requires more detailed assessment and other services, separate from the AT product itself. See Our Guidelines for more information.\\n\\nAssessment, fitting, training, customisation or other intervention by a professional, where required to deliver the correct equipment to meet a participant’s needs, are provided under therapeutic supports and are described in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\n\\nGuidance on AT complexity can be found in the NDIS AT Complexity Level Classification document located on the NDIS website under the Provider tab.\\n\\nNDIS ATHM and Consumables Code Guide 2023-24 Version 1.0\\n\\nPage 6 of 35\\n\\nSupport Item\\n\\nUnique numbers have been allocated for each support line item. Each number is allocated according to the following structure:\\n\\nProvider Registration Group\\n\\nSupport Category\\n\\nSupport Item\\n\\nOutcome Domain\\n\\nSupport Purpose\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n05_044839811_0103_1_2 - Standing Frames and Supports for Standing\\n\\nSupport\\n\\nAS/NZS\\n\\nLine Item\\n\\nRegistration\\n\\nOutcome\\n\\nSupport\\n\\nCategory\\n\\nISO9999Code\\n\\nGroup\\n\\nDomain\\n\\nPurpose\\n\\n05\\n\\n044839\\n\\n811\\n\\n0103\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\nUnits of Measure\\n\\nThe NDIS payment system includes units of measure for each support item as follows:\\n\\nEach • Week\\n\\nHour • Month\\n\\nDaily • Annual\\n\\nProviders should ensure that they record claims against a support item using the appropriate unit of measure for the support item.\\n\\nNDIS ATHM and Consumables Code Guide 2023-24 Version 1.0\\n\\nPage 7 of 35\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nWhen claiming, it is the responsibility of the provider to ensure that the claim accurately reflects the supports delivered, including the frequency and volume of supports. As a starting point, providers should claim against the relevant support line item which has been specified in the participant’s plan, or as stated in the Service Booking with the participant. Only where there is no specific line item identified, providers should claim payments against the support line item that most closely aligns to the product or service they have delivered.\\n\\nPayment requests should accurately reflect the Unit of Measure (UOM) indicated against the Support Item. Thus outright purchase will usually be for a single item (1 x $invoice each), while three hours of communication device programming would be 3 units against an hourly UOM (3 x $charge/hr).\\n\\nNote: Fractional units (e.g. 1.65 x $invoice each) are not permitted when claiming for assistive technology products except with the written authorisation of the NDIA. Claims for the balance remaining above the fixed price limits of a support item need to use the relevant ‘AT Supplementary Charge’ code.\\n\\nFor some supports (such as home or vehicle modifications), payments can be claimed in stages where this has been agreed to in negotiated Service Agreement with the participant and the NDIA has given prior approval in writing to the Registered Provider (see below under Prepayments).\\n\\nService Bookings\\n\\nA Service Booking is the way a participant (other than those self-managing their NDIS funding) engages with their chosen provider(s) online (unless their plan is part of the new NDIS PACE system). This ensures that both parties are aware of the item proposed and price for service, and that the participant will be able to pay for the service. Detailed aspects of the provision of the support should be clearly agreed with the participant in a Service Agreement.\\n\\nWhere quotes are required, the myplace Portal will automatically generate and issue an appropriate service booking after the quote has been provided and accepted.\\n\\nIn all other cases, a service booking should be made at either the category level (where the provider will claim using multiple codes – e.g. for the AT, delivery, programming) or using the support line item that most closely aligns to the product or service being delivered.\\n\\nFor more information please refer to the NDIS website and search for ‘service booking’.\\n\\nQuoting for AT or HM\\n\\nQuotes are required from providers for the provision of AT where indicated in this Guide. In some cases participants may also seek quotes for other items to compare between products. Participants can then decide whether or not to accept these quotes. The NDIA computer systems now make it possible for registered providers to submit their quote directly into the NDIA Business Systems through myplace Portal, in response to a Request for Quote through the myplace Portal.\\n\\nIt is important to note that not all quotes will be processed automatically. If the quote received is higher than NDIA thresholds for that support item, specific approval will be required from the NDIA, alternatively the NDIA may offer reasonable and necessary funding based on the best available pricing from the market. The participant is then able to decide whether they wish to proceed with the quote and pay the gap themselves (refer below about co-payments).\\n\\nNDIS ATHM and Consumables Code Guide 2023-24 Version 1.0\\n\\nPage 8 of 35\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nIdentification of supports in a participant’s plan, and approval of quotes, may require an assessment by a suitable AT assessor (please refer to Our Guidelines). Appropriate assessment by a suitable AT assessor is funded through relevant line items (e.g. ‘Therapeutic supports’) in the ‘Improved Daily Living Skills’ Support Category.\\n\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\n\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if they provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s plan. When the NDIA approves your quote, then a related service booking is created automatically. You will receive a message in your Inbox informing you that the service booking has been created.\\n\\nAT Supplementary Charge (not applicable where NDIA issued a Service Booking for Quotable AT)\\n\\nNDIS Price Limits for non-quotable AT are set to cover more than 80% of claims from the Australian market for that support. Where a participant’s needs require an AT support that exceeds that price limit, the participant (or their nominee) may agree for the provider to claim the balance of the support costs using an AT Supplementary Charge code in the same registration group as the main AT support. It is not possible for claims (in total) to exceed the available Capital (AT) budget.\\n\\nParticipants (or their nominee) must follow instructions in their plan as they spend their available budget – in particular the comments beside funded supports valued between $1,500 and $15,000, which indicate what type of AT is intended and include typical price bands for that AT.\\n\\nAT Supplementary Charge codes are not quotable, nor subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00. AT Supplementary Charge codes can only be used to claim the outstanding balance – not the whole supply transaction.\\n\\nExample – Making a claim where the price exceeds the fixed price of an AT item\\n\\nFor example; Participant/nominee agrees to purchase an Electronic Face-Face Communication AT for $8,500 based on their need, the AT advice they have and their budget.\\n\\n1. The provider must claim 1x unit of the appropriate AT code\\n\\nProvider claims: 1x Communication – Face to Face – Electronic 05_221315811_0124_1_2 @ $8,500\\n\\nThe NDIS Payments System may have a price limit of $8,000 for this item – it will pay $8,000 to the provider.\\n\\n2. Provider then claims the outstanding amount (noting the participant/nominee’s permission given in writing for the\\n\\nagreed price) using the right AT Supplementary Charge (0124 is the registration group)\\n\\nClaim 500 @$1 of AT Supplementary Charge -Communication and Information support 05_0002_0124_1_2 = $500.\\n\\nNDIS ATHM and Consumables Code Guide 2023-24 Version 1.0\\n\\nPage 9 of 35\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nSupport Item Ref No.\\n\\nNotional Amount\\n\\nSupport Item\\n\\nUOM\\n\\n05_0002_0103_1_2\\n\\nAT Supplementary Charge - AT Personal Care/Safety\\n\\nEach\\n\\n$1.00\\n\\n05_0002_0124_1_2\\n\\nAT Supplementary Charge -Communication and Information support\\n\\nEach\\n\\n$1.00\\n\\nAT Supplementary Charge - Hearing products\\n\\n05_0002_0122_1_2\\n\\nEach\\n\\n$1.00\\n\\n05_0002_0123_1_2\\n\\nAT Supplementary Charge - Household Tasks and Control\\n\\nEach\\n\\n$1.00\\n\\n05_0002_0105_1_2\\n\\nAT Supplementary Charge - Personal Mobility or Transfer\\n\\nEach\\n\\n$1.00\\n\\nAT Supplementary Charge - Prosthesis or Orthosis\\n\\n05_0002_0135_1_2\\n\\nEach\\n\\n$1.00\\n\\n05_0002_0112_1_2\\n\\nAT Supplementary Charge - Recreation including sport\\n\\nEach\\n\\n$1.00\\n\\n05_0002_0109_1_2\\n\\nAT Supplementary Charge - Vehicle modifications\\n\\nEach\\n\\n$1.00\\n\\nAT Supplementary Charge - Vision\\n\\n05_0002_0113_1_2\\n\\nEach\\n\\n$1.00\\n\\nClaiming for support items where notional unit prices apply\\n\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the NDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS ATHM and Consumables Code Guide.\\n\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\n\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\n\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price limit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\n\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\n\\nExample – Claiming for Rental Supports\\n\\nThe Rental support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\n\\nIf, as in the above example, the AT Rental - Vehicle modified for Access was $100 (in this example against the support item 05_121227125_0108_1_2) then the provider would submit a payment request for 100 units at $1.00 a unit for a total cost of $100.\\n\\nPrepayments\\n\\nIn general, Registered Providers can only make a claim for payment once a service booking has been created and the support has been delivered or provided.\\n\\nFor higher cost supports, the cost of the support may be claimed in stages in some circumstances, and before the support is finally delivered to the participant.\\n\\nPrepayments represent funds paid in advance of the provider delivering the agreed support to the participant. Sometimes providers require prepayment(s) as collateral and/or to cover their expenses in order to source, build or tailor the support to meet the participant’s unique needs.\\n\\nNDIS ATHM and Consumables Code Guide 2023-24 Version 1.0\\n\\nPage 10 of 35\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nIn general, prepayments should only be sought where a business will incur unrecoverable costs should delivery of the support to the requesting participant not proceed (e.g., a custom-made support).\\n\\nPrepayments are subject to all of the following conditions:\\n\\n\\n\\nthe support item is assistive technology (including vehicle modification), or a home modification; the support item value exceeds $1,500 or is custom made to address the participant’s disability related requirements, and a valid quote has been provided and accepted by the participant (or their nominee);\\n\\n\\n\\na service agreement between the provider and participant (or nominee) outlines the\\n\\nrequirement of a prepayment (e.g., deposit) or milestone payments, in line with normal business practice; and the final payment of not less than 10% of the total cost, may not be claimed until the participant has received the support, ready for use.\\n\\n\\n\\nA participant is entitled to a refund of any balance of prepayment(s) less the actual unrecoverable expense incurred by the business to that point when supply is terminated. The participant remains fully entitled to their rights under Australian Consumer Law in all circumstances.\\n\\nPrepayments can be claimed by providers for a support where that support is specifically identified as eligible for prepayments in this NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Other supports may be eligible for prepayment where the NDIA has given prior written approval (including conditions) to the registered provider to claim for prepayments.\\n\\nSubscription services\\n\\nIn some cases, a provider may claim for a service agreed with a participant using a subscription model of payment. In these cases, the participant is paying to be able to use that service (on the terms/hours agreed) for the period of the subscription. Subscriptions may only be used for the supply of the following supports: Consumables (Support Category 03) and Assistive Technology (Support Category 05).\\n\\nProviders wanting to claim for a subscription-based service must make sure that:\\n\\na plain English service agreement has been accepted by the participant, that makes clear to the participant the service and its costs (including any extra fees), as well as reasonable exit conditions the maximum price limit for a subscription is $5,000 per annum.\\n\\n• subscriptions are to be charged monthly (paid at or before the start of the service period). Small subscriptions, where the annual cost is not more than $1,500, may be charged less frequently (quarterly or annually). For example, if a subscription service cost $199 per year, it could be charged for just once per year. there are no penalties (for example exit fees) should a participant wish to cancel a subscription (with reasonable one month’s notice) on or prior to the end of the paid subscription period. invoices for the subscription to be paid clearly describe the supports for the participant to be delivered/available during the subscription period. For monthly subscriptions, participants may agree in writing to be billed quarterly (in advance of the quarter) but must be refunded any unused months if they cancel the subscription with due notice (as stated above).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNDIS ATHM and Consumables Code Guide 2023-24 Version 1.0\\n\\nPage 11 of 35\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nHigh value subscription claiming applies where the bundle of available Assistive Technology Products that a participant can access at any time is more than $15,000.\\n\\nFor high value AT, all the conditions of the subscription services apply, with exception to the maximum price limit, which is set to $10,000 per annum.\\n\\nAdditional payments are permitted for high value AT subscriptions as follows:\\n\\na) freight and in-home technical setup costs may be claimed at the commencement of the\\n\\nsubscription;\\n\\nb) removal and return of the supplied AT to the provider’s agent nearest the participant’s residence at the end of the subscription (which may coincide with the death of the participant); and\\n\\nc) each such claim under a) or b) shall not exceed one (1) month’s subscription fee or $600,\\n\\nwhichever is less.\\n\\nCo-payments for Capital items, including Assistive Technology\\n\\nCo-payments by the participant are not required. However, where a participant would like a support to be customised or assistive technology that is not considered reasonable or necessary, they are required to pay for this themselves. This may include an aesthetic customisation to an assistive technology or modifications to a vehicle that are additional to the assistive components.\\n\\nOther Fees and Charges\\n\\nAll registered providers must not add any other charge to the cost of the supports they provide to any participant, such as credit card surcharges, or any additional fees including any ‘gap’ fees, late payment fees or cancellation fees, unless otherwise permitted by the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Participants are generally not required to pay exit fees, even when changing provider’s part way through a plan. A core principle of the NDIS is choice and control for participants, allowing them to change providers without expense.\\n\\nGoods and Services Tax (GST)\\n\\nMany, but not all, NDIA supports provided to NDIS participants are GST-free. Further information about the NDIS and GST can be accessed on the Australian Taxation Office website. Providers should seek independent legal or financial advice if they require assistance with tax law compliance. If GST is applicable to a support, the price limit is inclusive of GST.\\n\\nNDIS ATHM and Consumables Code Guide 2023-24 Version 1.0\\n\\nPage 12 of 35\\n\\nLow cost assistive technology (mostly items <$1,500)\\n\\nParticipants who have AT needs may have funding included in their Consumables budget to enable them to purchase low-cost AT.\\n\\nParticipants who are self-managing low-cost AT\\n\\nMost participants who have low-cost AT included in their plan (under ‘Consumables’) can self-manage these supports. This enables participants to purchase low-cost AT directly from the provider of their choice, and to claim the payment via the myplace participant portal (no service booking required).\\n\\nParticipants whose funds are plan-managed\\n\\nParticipants whose funds are plan-managed will work with their Registered Plan Management Provider to make payment arrangements with their AT provider.\\n\\nParticipants whose funds are agency-managed\\n\\nParticipants who have opted to have their low-cost AT Agency-managed will need a service booking created in order for the provider to claim for low-cost AT in their in plan.\\n\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

Low-cost repairs and maintenance (e.g., repairing a strap on a prosthesis) outside the warranty period should generally be paid using a low-cost AT Support Item (allowing the greatest flexibility). Alternatively, the participant could use their unallocated Capital (AT) budget where appropriate.\\n\\nHigher cost repairs (>$1,500) are likely to be covered by a quotable Repairs and Maintenance Support Item included in the participant’s plan. The tables below contain repair codes against relevant AT categories.\\n\\nTo allow flexibility, most repair and maintenance funding is in the Capital budget, unallocated against any particular Support Item. Providers should use the relevant support item to claim participant agreed repairs to NDIS funded AT.\\n\\nMost of these support items are not subject to price limits, and use the Notional Amount claiming approach.

Additional information can be found in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements for Special Disability Accommodation.In this guide, Home Modifications (HM) are designed to provide safe access and comfortable mobility in frequently used areas within a participant’s home. Home modifications include design and construction, as well as installation of fixtures or fittings and changes to structural and non-structural components of the home. The Home Modifications Guidance for Builders and Designers provides further clarity on the diverse range of home modifications that the NDIS may consider reasonable and necessary.\\n\\nSome simple low-cost home adaptation items (<$1,500) may be claimed as Assistive Technology under the “Assistive products for household tasks and access” category. They should not be separately claimed if they are part of a Home Modification support category (for example grab rails would be included in a Minor Bathroom modification).\\n\\nAll Home Modification support needs must be assessed by an Occupational Therapist. Minor Home Modification (MHM) includes changes to a home that are relatively low risk and straightforward, non-structural, generally impact one or two areas in a home and usually cost less than $20,000 in total. The pre-determined budgets allocated to participants who require MHM supports are based on current market costs that are updated periodically. Further detail is published in the Operational Guideline - Home Modifications. Providers should use the appropriate MHM code for the works undertaken, plus the MHM Practical Completion code (equivalent to 10% of the works budget) after the completion of the works. Note: Budgets provided are in line with the expectation that GST would not apply (see Goods and Services Tax (GST)).\\n\\nComplex Home Modifications (CHM) which involve structural changes and require a greater level of certification, require a detailed specification of works and up to two quotes. The CHM assessment must be undertaken by a suitably qualified and/or experienced home modification assessor. Funding for a building construction practitioner (BCP) will be included to help the participant to explore the best options to achieve an accessible dwelling and help them navigate the CHM process. The BCP can also provide a cost estimate for the NDIA to review the CHM, otherwise 2 builder’s quotes are required.\\n\\nAn approved CHM will be described against the specific home modification support item codes shown below.\\n\\nCapital budget funding will be provided for modifications that are reasonable and necessary for the participant. A participant is free to choose a more expensive option at their own expense, where the more expensive option is not reasonable and necessary. For example, where a home modification has been approved for a participant, but the participant would like cosmetic or personalised fittings that are above that considered reasonable and necessary, the NDIA will cover the cost of reasonable and necessary modifications, and the participant will pay the additional costs.\\n\\nHome modifications\\n\\nThis area incorporates design and subsequent changes to the participant’s home. Home modification design and construction includes installation of equipment or changes to building structures, fixture or fittings to enable participants to live more independently and safely at home.\\n\\nSupport Item\\n\\nSupport Item Ref No.\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nUOM\\n\\nQuote Required\\n\\nNotional Amount\\n\\nHM - Building Works Project Management\\n\\n06_182490112_0111_2_2\\n\\nOversight and management of a complex home modification by a Building Works Project Manager.\\n\\nEach\\n\\nY\\n\\nQuotable\\n\\n06_182495421_0111_2_2\\n\\nEach\\n\\nY\\n\\nQuotable\\n\\nHM - Certification and Compliance Approval\\n\\nCertification of completed building works as compliant.

The NDIS provides funding to eligible individuals (“participants”) so that they can purchase, in the open market, the disability related goods and services (“supports”) that they need. The NDIS is administered by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA). The NDIA has a role, as market steward, to create an efficient and sustainable consumer driven marketplace for the supply of disability supports. It regulates the commercial relationships between providers and participants, including through price regulation. The pricing arrangements aim to maintain and increase market supply, and help markets grow to a more mature state in the future, while recognising the need for financial sustainability. Further information on the NDIA’s approach to pricing can be found in the NDIS Pricing Strategy and in the Final Report of the Annual Pricing Review 2022-23.\\n\\nThe NDIA uses the Disability Support Worker Cost Model that is described in this document to determine the price limits for supports that are delivered by Disability Support Workers (DSWs).\\n\\nThe DSW Cost Model estimates the fully loaded cost of a billable hour of support considering : base pay; shift loadings; leave entitlements; salary on costs; employee allowances; operational overheads (including supervision costs, utilisation costs and workers’ compensation costs); corporate overheads and margin.\\n\\nThe Cost Model estimates the efficient costs of providing supports by considering:\\n\\nBase Salary costs, including shift loadings. Note that in the Cost Model, costs are\\n\\nbased on permanent worker costs.\\n\\nDirect On-costs, which covers those costs of employment associated with Superannuation entitlements, Annual Leave entitlements, Personal Leave entitlements, Long Service Leave entitlements and Employee Allowances.\\n\\nOperational Overheads, which covers those costs that are in the operational control of the provider and include workers compensation costs, utilisation costs (billable versus unbillable hours), supervision costs (including quality and safeguarding costs) and workforce rostering and balance measures such as the share of the workforce that is permanent or casual, and the extent to which overtime is used by the business.\\n\\nCorporate Overheads, which covers those costs incurred to run the administrative side of a business. These costs include the accounting, human resources, legal, marketing, and information technology functions.\\n\\nMargin, which represents the return that the provider makes because of the provision\\n\\nof working capital to the business.\\n\\nTemporary Loading which recognises the variable costs of COVID and of adjusting to\\n\\nthe new provisions in the Social, Community, Home Care and Disability Services Industry Award 2010 (SCHADS Industry Award) that were come into effect on 1 July 2023. These costs are being closely monitored by the NDIA.\\n\\n4\\n\\nDescription of the Cost Model\\n\\nThis section sets out the methodology and assumptions of the NDIS DSW Cost Model.\\n\\nBase Salary and Shift Loadings\\n\\nThe NDIA recognises that some Disability Support Workers are classified as Home Care Employees and others are classified as Social and Community Services Employees under the SCHADS Industry Award.1 The Cost Model take its parameters from the Social and Community Services Employees section for the SCHADS Industry Award, which has the more generous provisions. The NDIA also recognises that some Disability Support Workers are employed under Enterprise Bargaining Agreements (EBAs). However, these EBAs must leave the worker no worse off overall than they would be under the relevant Award. Any additional benefits offered by EBAs over the Award have been agreed to by providers and are often offset by productivity gains. The NDIA therefore considers the conditions set out in the Social and Community Services Employees section of the SCHADS Industry Award to be the most appropriate foundation for the DSW Cost Model.\\n\\nThe NDIA recognises that providers must employ Disability Support Workers with different skill levels and levels of experience to meet the different needs of participants. The Cost Model therefore has different sets of cost assumptions for four types of workers that will be referred to as DSW Level 1, DSW Level 2, DSW Level 3 and DSW Level 4.\\n\\nTable 1 sets out the Cost Model’s assumptions with respect to the base pay of DSWs.\\n\\nTable 1: Assumed SCHADS Industry Award Classifications and Pay Rates, 1 July 2023\\n\\nAssumed SCHADS Classification\\n\\nAward Hourly Rate\\n\\nDSW Level 1\\n\\n2.3\\n\\n$34.22\\n\\nDSW Level 2\\n\\n2.4/3.1\\n\\n$35.57\\n\\nDSW Level 3\\n\\n3.2\\n\\n$37.03\\n\\nDSW Level 4\\n\\n4.4\\n\\n$44.68\\n\\nTable 2 sets out the Cost Model’s assumptions with respect to shift loadings.2\\n\\nTable 2: Shift Loadings, 1 July 2023\\n\\nShift\\n\\nPermanent Loading\\n\\nWeekday\\n\\n0.0%\\n\\nSaturday\\n\\n50.0%\\n\\nSunday\\n\\n100.0%\\n\\nPublic Holiday\\n\\n150.0%\\n\\nEvening Shift\\n\\n12.5%\\n\\nNight Shift\\n\\n15.0%\\n\\n1 The SCHADS Industry Award can be viewed here.\\n\\n2 SCHADS Industry Award: Clauses 10.4(b), 26 and 29.3.\\n\\n5\\n\\nNational Disability Insurance Scheme – Disability Support Worker Cost Model 2023-24\\n\\nDirect On-costs\\n\\nDirect On-costs consist of leave costs (days worked versus days paid), plus salary-like on- costs (superannuation and employee allowances).\\n\\nDays Worked Versus Days Paid\\n\\nThe Cost Model recognises that under the SCHADS Industry Award a permanent worker’s ordinary hours of work will be 38 hours per week3, and that they will be available to work on 220 days a year, because under the SCHADS Industry Award and the National Employment Standards4 they must be paid for:\\n\\n20 days of annual leave;5\\n\\n10 days of public holidays;6\\n\\n10 days of personal leave7; plus domestic and family violence leave8.\\n\\nThe Cost Model recognises that providers need to accrue the revenue to meet the costs of these leave accruals during the billable hours of the DSW. The Cost Model assumes that all annual, public holiday, and personal leave entitlements are drawn on, including personal leave. It assumes that the number of workers accessing family and domestic violence leave to be 2.3%, with those accessing the leave assumed to be accessing the entire minimum entitlement.\\n\\nThe Cost Model also recognises that workers accrue Long Service Leave (LSL) entitlements when they work and that again providers need to accrue the revenue to meet the costs of this leave accrual during the billable hours of the DSW. The Cost Model assumes that workers accrue 4⅓ days of long service leave each year.9 The Cost Model assumes that all long service leave entitlements are drawn on.\\n\\nIn line with the SCHADS Industry Award, the Cost Model also provides a 17.5% loading for annual leave to compensate workers for the shifts they would have otherwise taken.10\\n\\n3 SCHADS Industry Award: Clause 25.1.\\n\\n4 The National Employment Standards govern leave and several other conditions in Awards, and also may not be reduced by EBAs. https://www.fairwork.gov.au/employee-entitlements/national-employment-standards\\n\\n5 https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/annual-leave\\n\\n6 https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/public-holidays\\n\\n7 https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/sick-and-carers-leave/paid-sick-and-carers-leave\\n\\nNote: The Cost Model assumes all workers utilise all of their personal leave entitlement each year even though some workers may not use their entitlement.\\n\\n8 https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/family-and-domestic-violence-leave/employer-guide-to-family-and-\\n\\ndomestic-violence\\n\\n9 https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/long-service-leave\\n\\nNote: The Cost Model assumes all workers qualify for LSL accruals and that all workers will eventually access their LSL entitlement. This reflects the rollout of portable LSL schemes in some jurisdictions.\\n\\n10 SCHADS Industry Award: Clause 31.3\\n\\n6\\n\\nNational Disability Insurance Scheme – Disability Support Worker Cost Model 2023-24\\n\\nSuperannuation\\n\\nThe Cost Model assumes that in 2023-24 superannuation is paid at the statutory 11.0% of base salary, including while on leave.11\\n\\nEmployee allowances\\n\\nThe Cost Model assumes that employee allowances are on average equal to 1.0% of base salary on average.\\n\\nCumulative Impact of Direct on-costs\\n\\nThe impacts of leave loadings and direct on-costs are shown in Table 3.\\n\\nTable 3: Impact of Direct On-Costs on the Cost per Worked Hour of a DSW\\n\\nDSW 1\\n\\nDSW 2\\n\\nDSW 3\\n\\nDSW 4\\n\\nStandard Hourly Rate\\n\\n$34.22\\n\\n$35.57\\n\\n$37.03\\n\\n$44.68\\n\\nAllowance for Annual leave\\n\\na.

Temporary Transformation Payment (TTP)\\n\\nThe 2023-24price limit for each TTP support item is higher than the price limit for the equivalent non-TTP item. In 2023-24, the TTP additional amount is equal to 1.5% of the relevant DSW 1 hourly price limit for each time of day and day of week.\\n\\n2. Assistance with Self Care Activities - Night-Time Sleepover Support\\n\\nThe price limit for these support items is equal to the SCHADS Industry Award Sleepover Allowance12 plus three times the relevant DSW 1 Weekday Night hourly price limit.\\n\\n3. Establishment Fee for Personal Care/Participation\\n\\nThe price limit for this support item is 10 times the relevant DSW 1 Weekday Daytime hourly price limit.\\n\\n4. Short Term Accommodation and Assistance (including the respite care)\\n\\nThe daily price limits for each 1:n weekday support item is the sum of the following amounts, where n is the number of participants being supported by the worker:\\n\\nThe short term accommodation capital component (see page 10);\\n\\nThe short term accommodation hotel component (see page 10);\\n\\n1/n times 8 times the relevant DSW 2 Weekday Daytime hourly price limit;\\n\\n1/n times 8 times the relevant DSW 2 Weekday Evening hourly price limit;\\n\\n1/n times 8 times the relevant DSW 2 Weekday Night hourly price limit.\\n\\nThe 2023-24daily price limits for each 1:n Saturday support item is the sum of the following amounts:\\n\\nThe short term accommodation capital component (see page 10);\\n\\nThe short term accommodation hotel component (see page 10);\\n\\n1/n times 24 times the relevant DSW 2 Saturday hourly price limit.\\n\\nThe 2023-24 daily price limits for each 1:n Sunday support item is the sum of the following amounts:\\n\\nThe short term accommodation capital component (see page 10);\\n\\nThe short term accommodation hotel component (see page 10);\\n\\n1/n times 24 times the relevant DSW 2 Sunday hourly price limit.\\n\\nThe 2023-24daily price limits for each 1:n Public Holiday support item is the sum of the following amounts:\\n\\nThe short term accommodation capital component (see page 10);\\n\\n12 Calculated as 4.9% of the weekly minimum wage (before Equal Remuneration Order adjustment) for a Social and community services employee level 3 at pay point 3 in clause 15.3 of the SCHADS Industry Award.

Group Activities (Transitional Arrangement)\\n\\nThe price limits for community-based group supports apply to each hour of support and are based on the hourly price limits of the relevant 1:1 community participation support (for each level of support and time of day and day of week). If the price limit for the relevant 1:1 support is P, and n is the number of participants being supported by the worker, then the price limit Pn for the 1:n community based support is given by the following formulae:\\n\\n𝑃 + (𝑛 − 1) × 0.12 × 𝑃 𝑛\\n\\n𝑃𝑛 =\\n\\nFor each additional person in the group (after the first) an additional 12.0% of the 1:1 hourly price limit (essentially seven minutes) is added to the hourly price limit.\\n\\nThe hourly transitional price limit for a centre-based group support is calculated by adding the hourly Centre Based Capital Amount (see page 10) to the hourly transitional price limit for the relevant community based group support.\\n\\n6. Onsite Shared Supports in SDA\\n\\nThe price limit for Onsite Shared Supports in SDA or commonly known as the Concierge support is determined weekly claiming calculated by under a program of supports is $1,365.88 (2.5 hours x $78.05 ph. x 7 weeks) as the intention is that it is claimed on this basis for each day of the agreement. This sets the expectation of regular check ins that supports are working and the provider does not need to claim on an hourly basis and reinforces the idea it is a 24/7 available support.\\n\\n24', metadata={'source': '../../data/ndis/PB NDIS Disability Support Worker Cost Model Assumptions and Methodology 2023-24 v1.0.docx.pdf'}), Document(page_content='National Disability Insurance Scheme\\n\\nHome and Living Demonstration Projects Addendum\\n\\n2023-24\\n\\nValid from: 1 July 2023 Version 1.0 (Released 16 June 2023)\\n\\nndis.gov.au\\n\\nCopyright © National Disability Insurance Agency 2023\\n\\nUse of National Disability Insurance Agency copyright material The material in this document with the exception of logos, trademarks, third party material and other content as specified is licensed under Creative Commons CC NC licence, version 4.0.

The claim accounts for the package of assistance with daily life supports that will be provided within the funded weekly amount for both shared and individual supports. This bundled support includes all agreed supports within a typical week in the shared living environment that is agreed.\\n\\nThis support item is subject to a service agreement between the provider and participant (or nominee) specifying:\\n\\nAn agreement to claim weekly amounts; and\\n\\nThe agreed supports to be provided for the weekly amount claimed.\\n\\nThis support item can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.

This may also encompass irregular supports if agreed with the participant. The item may be claimed through either of the below approaches\\n\\nAn agreed flexible weekly claim amount as negotiated between provider and\\n\\nparticipant; or\\n\\nA standard weekly claim amount through dividing by the number of weeks in the plan period.

Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is subject to regulation by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) and the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission through the provisions of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 and its subordinate legislation.\\n\\nThis document, which is called the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits, and its associated documents (see below), set out the pricing arrangements and price limits that the NDIA has determined will apply to the provision of supports for participants in the NDIS. The intent of these documents is to assist participants and providers, both current and prospective, to understand the ways in which price controls work in the NDIS. Price regulation is in place to help ensure that participants receive value for money when they purchase the supports that they need.\\n\\nPrice regulation documents\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits\\n\\nThis document sets out the general pricing arrangements that apply to all supports in the NDIS and the specific arrangements that apply to individual supports.\\n\\nNDIS Support Catalogue\\n\\nThis document provides information on the current price limits for each support item and indicates for each price-limited support item the claim types (Travel, non-face-to-face, etc.) that can be used. Requirements specified in the Support Catalogue are part of the pricing arrangements and price limits that the NDIA has determined should apply to NDIS.\\n\\nThe NDIA sometimes deactivates support items. Deactivated support items cannot be used. Before a support is deactivated it is converted into a Legacy Support for a period of time. These legacy supports are listed in a separate tab of the Support Catalogue for the information of providers and participants. Providers and participants should not create new service bookings for legacy supports. In general, claims for legacy supports should only continue to be made against a service booking if that service booking was in existence at the time the support was turned into a legacy support.\\n\\nAddenda to the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits\\n\\nThese documents allow the NDIA to respond to changing market conditions in an efficient manner. They are used to make temporary changes to some of the support items and arrangements listed in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Addenda are not stand-alone documents and must be read in conjunction with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Requirements specified in Addenda are part of the pricing arrangements and price limits that the NDIA has determined will apply to NDIS.\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation\\n\\nThis document sets out the specific pricing arrangements that apply for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Providers of SDA supports are also subject to the general arrangements set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\n\\nPage 8 of 101\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nNDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and Consumables Code Guide\\n\\nThis document gives further information on the specific pricing arrangements that apply for these types of support. Providers of these supports are also subject to the general arrangements set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\n\\nPriority of Interpretation\\n\\nTo the extent of any inconsistency between provisions of the various documents that set out the pricing arrangements for the NDIS, priority will be accorded in descending order to:\\n\\n(a) The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits;\\n\\n(b) The NDIS Support Catalogue;\\n\\n(c) Any Addenda to the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits;\\n\\n(d) The NDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation; and\\n\\n(e) The NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and Consumables Code Guide.\\n\\nThese documents are updated from time to time and are published on the NDIS website. Participants and providers should always refer to the website version of a document when they are seeking to understand pricing arrangements that apply in the NDIS.\\n\\nApplicability of Price Limits\\n\\nSupports can be subject to price regulation in different ways:\\n\\nPrice controlled supports should only be claimed by a provider from a participant’s plan when they are reasonable and necessary to meet a participant’s needs and are subject to the conditions set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\n\\nQuotable supports should only be claimed by a provider from a participant’s plan if the\\n\\nsupport is specifically included in the participant’s plan. They are subject to the conditions set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\n\\nSome supports are not subject to price control. These supports should only be claimed by a provider from a participant’s plan when they are reasonable and necessary to meet the participant’s needs. They are subject to the other conditions set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\n\\nIn most cases, support items subject to price limits have a single national price limit. In some cases, there are different price limits for different jurisdictions. Higher price limits can apply in remote and very remote areas.\\n\\nThe pricing arrangements do not only set the price limits for supports. They also specify when and how supports can be claimed, including what has to have happened for a support to be claimable.\\n\\nAgency Managed Participants\\n\\nA provider of a support that is agency managed in a participant’s plan:\\n\\nMust be a Registered Provider with the NDIS;\\n\\nMust declare relevant prices and conditions to participants before delivering a service,\\n\\nincluding any notice periods or cancellation terms; and\\n\\nMust adhere to the arrangements prescribed in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\n\\nLimits, including ensuring that their prices do not exceed the price limits.\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 9 of 101\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe NDIA does not set the prices that providers charge participants. Each provider must agree the price for each support with each participant, subject to the price limits and pricing arrangements that are imposed by the NDIA.\\n\\nProviders should not indicate in any way to participants that the prices that they charge are set by the NDIA.\\n\\nIn general, providers should not charge NDIS participants more for a support than they would charge anyone else for the same support. If the price a provider offers to a NDIS participant is different to that which they would offer to a person who was not an NDIA participant, then the provider should ensure that the participant is aware of this difference and the reasons for the difference.\\n\\nProviders are required to acknowledge compliance with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its associated documents when submitting a payment request through the myplace Provider Portal.\\n\\nPlan Managed Participants\\n\\nPlan managers must adhere to the arrangements prescribed in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits, including ensuring that the prices charged by providers do not exceed the price limits. This rule applies regardless of whether the participant purchases the support from a registered or an unregistered provider.\\n\\nPlan managers must provide the Australian Business Number (ABN) of the service provider who delivers the support for all payment requests. The NDIA will only accept payment requests without an ABN if the service provider is exempt from quoting an ABN under Australian Taxation Office (ATO) rules. Exempt providers must complete the ATO’s Statement by a Supplier form. Plan managers are expected to keep a copy of the completed form.\\n\\nPlan managers must always ensure that a valid tax invoice is included with relevant information about the goods/services purchased for all payment requests. A plan manager may be liable to pay back any amount not spent in accordance with a participant’s plan.\\n\\nPlan managers are required to acknowledge compliance with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its associated documents when submitting payment requests through the myplace Provider Portal.\\n\\nSelf-managing Participants\\n\\nSelf-managing participants can use registered or unregistered providers and are not subject to the price limits or other pricing arrangements set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its associated documents.\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 10 of 101\\n\\nSupport Purposes, Support Categories and Support Items\\n\\nThis section describes the way that the NDIS categorises disability supports. These categories can be relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for providers when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\n\\nSupport Items\\n\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items listed in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue. Providers should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they have delivered.\\n\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\n\\nSupport Category\\n\\nSequence Number\\n\\nRegistration Group\\n\\nOutcome Domain\\n\\nSupport Purpose\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\n\\nSupport Category\\n\\nSequence Number\\n\\nRegistration Group\\n\\nOutcome Domain\\n\\nSupport Purpose\\n\\n01\\n\\n013\\n\\n0107\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\nSupport Purposes\\n\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant budgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support budgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or capacity building supports).\\n\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\n\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this support purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\n\\nskills.\\n\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\n\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the goals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes Framework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and overall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which help participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore where supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These domains are:\\n\\n1. Daily Living\\n\\n5. Work\\n\\n2. Home\\n\\n6. Social and Community Participation\\n\\n3. Health and Wellbeing\\n\\n7. Relationships\\n\\nPage 11 of 101\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nSupport Purposes, Support Categories and Support Items\\n\\n1. Daily Living\\n\\n5. Work\\n\\n4. Lifelong Learning\\n\\n8. Choice and Control\\n\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must contribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan. Support purpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support categories. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and providers to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant’s goals.\\n\\nThe following table shows the links between support purpose types, domains in the Outcomes Framework and support categories.\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nOUTCOME DOMAIN\\n\\n1.\\n\\nSUPPORT CATEGORY\\n\\nCORE\\n\\nDaily Living 2.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must not exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make accurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support. Claims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered. Falsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the provider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\n\\nService Agreements\\n\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to ensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n\\nExpectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n\\nThe respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\n\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\n\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They can include information such as:\\n\\nWhat supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n\\nThe prices of those supports and services;\\n\\nHow, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n\\nThe duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n\\nHow the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n\\nHow any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n\\nParticipant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n\\nProvider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\n\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that are not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its associated documents.\\n\\nService Bookings\\n\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a support they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the myplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each service booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of service delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\n\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where possible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible basis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must have a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information can be found on the NDIS website.\\n\\nPage 14 of 101\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\n\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if they provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s plan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item that the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\n\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\n\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with the participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for the item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\n\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\n\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\n\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of $50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\n\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\n\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on the reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule for the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These claims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be claimed for after they have been delivered.\\n\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the NDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and Consumables Code Guide.\\n\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\n\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\n\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price limit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\n\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\n\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\n\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\n\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against the support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit for a total cost of $21.50.\\n\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\n\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the support is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as determined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\n\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the support was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered. (Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 15 of 101\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nA Night-time Sleepover Support is any support to a participant delivered on a weekday, a\\n\\nSaturday, a Sunday or a Public Holiday that:\\n\\no Commences before midnight on a day and finishes after midnight on that day; and\\n\\no Is for a continuous period of eight (8) hours or more; and\\n\\no The worker is allowed to sleep when they are not providing support.\\n\\nA Public Holiday Support is any support to a participant that starts at or after midnight on the night prior to a Public Holiday and ends before or at midnight of that Public Holiday (unless it is a Night-time Sleepover Support).\\n\\nA Saturday Support is any support to a participant that starts at or after midnight on the\\n\\nnight prior to a Saturday and ends before or at midnight of that Saturday (unless it is a Public Holiday or Night-time Sleepover Support).\\n\\nA Sunday Support is any support to a participant that starts at or after midnight on the night prior to a Sunday and ends before or at midnight of that Sunday (unless it is a Public Holiday or Night-time Sleepover Support).\\n\\nA Weekday Support is any other support:\\n\\no For Disability Support Workers:\\n\\n▪ A Weekday Daytime Support is any support to a participant that starts at or after 6:00 am and ends before or at 8:00 pm on a single weekday (unless it is a Public Holiday or Night-time Sleepover Support).\\n\\n▪ A Weekday Evening Support is any support to a participant that starts after 8:00 pm and finishes at or before midnight on a single weekday (unless it is a Public Holiday or Night-time Sleepover Support).\\n\\n▪ A Weekday Night Support is any support to a participant that commences at or before midnight on a weekday and finishes after midnight on that weekday, or commences before 6:00 am on a weekday and finishes on that weekday (unless it is a Public Holiday, Saturday, Sunday or Night-time Sleepover Support).\\n\\no For Nurses delivering Nursing Supports:\\n\\n▪ A Weekday Daytime Support is any support to a participant that commences before 12.00 noon on a Weekday and finishes on the same day (unless it is a Public Holiday, Weekday Evening, or Weekday Night Support).\\n\\n▪ A Weekday Evening Support is any support to a participant that commences not earlier than 12.00 noon on a Weekday and finishes after 6.00 pm on the same day (unless it is a Public Holiday Support).\\n\\n▪ A Weekday Night Support is any support to a participant that commences on or after 6.00 pm on a Weekday and finishes before 7.30 am on the following day (unless it is a Public Holiday Support).\\n\\nIf a support to a participant does not meet one of the above criteria then it needs to be billed as two or more separate supports. An exception to this general rule occurs when a particular support crosses a shift boundary and the same worker delivers the entire support. In this case, the higher of the relevant price limits applies to the entire support and the provider should make the claim against the relevant support item. Providers are required to discuss this billing arrangement with the participant.\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 16 of 101\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nNight-Time Sleepover supports\\n\\nThis support provides a participant with assistance with, or supervision of, personal tasks of daily life where overnight support is needed, but the caregiver can sleep when not required to provide support. This support applies to any day of the week and on public holidays. This support item includes up to two hours of active supports provided to the participant for the duration of the period. Providers may claim for the third or additional hour at Saturday rates on weekdays, or at applicable rates on other days (Saturday, Sunday or Public Holidays).\\n\\nNote, there is no night-time sleepover support item for nurses.\\n\\nClaiming for Telehealth Services\\n\\nTelehealth can be used to deliver direct supports where appropriate and with the agreement of the participant.\\n\\nProviders can only claim Telehealth Services where the following conditions are met:\\n\\nThe delivery of the support by telehealth is appropriate; and\\n\\nThe proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\n\\nPrice Limits and with the Service Agreement with the participant; and\\n\\nThe activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant (rather\\n\\nthan a general activity such as enrolment, administration or staff rostering); and\\n\\nThe provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\n\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the participant); and\\n\\nThe provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement between the participant and provider specifies that Telehealth services can be claimed).\\n\\nProviders have a duty of care to their participants to ensure they are providing the same standard of care through video technology as in a clinical setting.\\n\\nClaims for Telehealth Services should be made using the relevant support item as indicated in NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits by using the “Telehealth Services” option in the myplace portal.\\n\\nClaiming for Non-direct Services\\n\\nNon-Face-to-Face Support Provision\\n\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for the Non-Face-to-Face delivery of a support item if all of the following conditions are met:\\n\\nThe NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for Non-\\n\\nFace-to-Face Support Provision in respect of that support item; and\\n\\nThe proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\n\\nPrice Limits and with the Service Agreement with the participant; and\\n\\nThe activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant or in the case of group-based supports, are required to enable the group support to be delivered (rather than a general activity such as enrolment, administration or staff rostering); and\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 17 of 101\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nThe provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\n\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the participant); and\\n\\nThe provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\n\\nbetween the participant and provider specifies that Non-Face-to-Face supports can be claimed).\\n\\nFor example, the Assistance with Self Care support items are described as covering activities “Assisting with, and/or supervising, personal tasks of daily life to develop skills of the participant to live as autonomously as possible”. Therefore, time spent on Non-Face-to-Face activities that assist the participant – for example, writing reports for co-workers and other providers about the client’s progress with skill development – could be claimed against this support item.\\n\\nThe costs of training and up-skilling staff, and of supervision, are included in the base price limits for supports and are not considered billable Non-Face-to-Face supports. However, research undertaken by a capacity-building provider specifically linked to the needs of a participant and to the achievement of the participant’s goals may be billable as a Non-Face-to-Face support with the participant’s prior agreement.\\n\\nService agreements with each client can ‘pre-authorise’ these activities, but providers should only claim a support item from a participant’s plan if they have completed activities that are part of the support for that participant. Charging a fee that is not linked to completed activities is not permitted.\\n\\nTime spent on administration, such as the processing of NDIS payment claims for all clients, should not be claimed from a participant’s budget as a Non-Face-to-Face support. The NDIS price limits include an allowance for overheads, including the costs of administration tasks. Examples of administrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and that should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n\\nPre-engagement visits;\\n\\nDeveloping and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n\\nEntering or amending participant details into system;\\n\\nMaking participant service time changes;\\n\\nStaff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n\\nOngoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n\\nCompleting a quoting tool;\\n\\nMaking service bookings; and\\n\\nMaking payment claims.\\n\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant in the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\n\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non- Face-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\n\\nProvider Travel\\n\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a support item if all of the following conditions are met:\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 18 of 101\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nThe NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\n\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n\\nThe proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\n\\nPrice Limits and\\n\\nThe activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n\\nThe support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n\\nThe provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\n\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the participant); and\\n\\nThe provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\n\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed); and\\n\\nThe provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\n\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is a sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or between participants.\\n\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\n\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel time that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\n\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are permitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent travelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable when the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel time that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\n\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is reasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where applicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment should be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\n\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary support and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect of a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant for the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the participant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\n\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\n\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face- to-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution towards these costs.

Providers should assist participants to minimise the travel costs that they need to pay (for example, by co-ordinating appointments with other participants in an area, so that travel costs can be shared between participants, or by considering the delivery of the support by telehealth where appropriate).\\n\\nShort Notice Cancellations\\n\\nWhere a provider has a Short Notice Cancellation (or no show), they are able to claim 100% of the agreed fee associated with the activity from the participant’s plan, subject to the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and the terms of the service agreement with the participant.\\n\\nA cancellation is a short notice cancellation if the participant:\\n\\nDoes not show up for a scheduled support within a reasonable time, or is not present at the agreed place and within a reasonable time when the provider is travelling to deliver the support; or\\n\\nHas given less than seven (7) clear days’ notice for a support.\\n\\nFor supports delivered to a group of participants, if a participant cancels their attendance and if the provider is unable find another participant to attend the group session in their place then, if the other requirements for a short notice cancellation are met, the provider is permitted to bill the participant who has made the short notice cancellation at the previously agreed rate that they\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 22 of 101\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nwould have billed if the participant had attended the group. All other participants in the group should also be billed as though all participants had attended the group.\\n\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a Short Notice Cancellation of the delivery of a support item to the participant if all of the following conditions are met:\\n\\nThe NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for Short\\n\\nNotice Cancellations in respect of that support item; and\\n\\nThe proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\n\\nPrice Limits; and\\n\\nThe provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement between the participant and provider should specify that Short Notice Cancellations can be claimed); and\\n\\nThe provider was not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and are required to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.\\n\\nClaims for a short notice cancellation should be made using the same support item as would have been used if the support had been delivered, using the “Cancellation” option in the myplace portal.\\n\\nThere is no hard limit on the number of short notice cancellations (or no shows) for which a provider can claim in respect of a participant. However, providers have a duty of care to their participants and if a participant has an unusual number of cancellations, then the provider should seek to understand why they are occurring. The NDIA will monitor claims for cancellations and may contact providers who have a participant with an unusual number of cancellations.\\n\\nExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\n\\nA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\n\\nThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.\\n\\nIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the provider can claim for this support. The claim should be made at the agreed rate for the service against the relevant support item using the drop-down field “Cancellation”.\\n\\nNDIA Requested Reports\\n\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a NDIA Requested Report if all of the following conditions are met:\\n\\nThe NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for NDIA Requested Reports in respect of that support item and the proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits; and\\n\\nThe provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (i.e., the service agreement with the participant should specify that NDIA Requested Reports can be claimed); and\\n\\nThe report is requested by the NDIA.\\n\\nA report is considered to have been requested by the NDIA if it is a report that is required at the commencement of a plan that outlines plan objectives and goals, or at plan review that measures functional outcomes against the originally stipulated goals, or that makes recommendations for ongoing needs (informal, community, mainstream or funded supports). Providers may also claim for other NDIA-requested therapy report that is stipulated as being required in a participant’s plan.\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 23 of 101\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nClaims for NDIS requested reports should be made using the relevant support item, using the “NDIA Report” option in the myplace portal.\\n\\nClaiming for Activity Based Transport\\n\\nActivity Based Transport – Social, Economic and Community Participation Supports\\n\\nProviders of supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation Support Category (“community participation supports”) can, at the request of a participant, transport a participant to, or from, or as part of, a community participation support. In these cases, the provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the time that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community participation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with transporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\n\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the total time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent accompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more participants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This claim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the participant’s core budget.\\n\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or transporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution towards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n\\nFor a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n\\nFor a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n\\nFor other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\n\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n\\nSupport items\\n\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support item. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants subject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is transporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be apportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\n\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

The support worker accompanies the participant in the vehicle. They then provide 40 minutes of support to the participant at the pool. Afterwards, they spend 20 minutes returning the participant to their home by the same vehicle.

This amount also applies to the support worker’s time when transporting participants.\\n\\nThe provider and participant have also agreed for the provider to claim for the activity-based transport costs, which in this case they have agreed are the support worker’s car park fee ($4.50) and vehicle running costs at a rate as agreed with the participant of $0.85 a kilometre (2x10 km) against support line item\\n\\nThe provider’s claim for the support will be claimed in the Portal as:\\n\\n\\n\\n$70.83 for the 40 minutes of direct support at the swimming pool and 45 minutes transport time against support item 04_104_0125_6_1;\\n\\n\\n\\n$21.50 for the non-labour costs of the activity-based transport against the support item 04_590_0125_6_1.\\n\\nNote: The provider may also be able to make a claim for the time taken by the worker to travel to the participant before the support commences (see the discussion of Provider Travel above).\\n\\nRegional, Remote and Very Remote Areas\\n\\nDifferent pricing arrangements can apply depending on whether a support is delivered in a regional remote or very remote area.\\n\\nModified Monash Model\\n\\nTo determine whether a support is being delivered in a regional remote or very remote area the NDIA uses a modification of the Modified Monash Model (MMM). From the 24 October 2020, the 2019 version of the MMM will be used by the NDIS.\\n\\nThe MMM determines regional, remote and very remote areas using a scale based on population size and locality (see Table below).\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nNDIA Zone\\n\\nMMM\\n\\nInclusion\\n\\nAll areas categorised as Major Cities of Australia in the Australian Bureau of Statistics Australian Statistical Geography Standard – Remoteness Areas (ASGS- RA) framework (see the ABS website).\\n\\nMetropolitan\\n\\nMMM 1\\n\\n1\\n\\nAreas categorised as Inner Regional Australia or Outer Regional Australia in the ASGS-RA that are in, or within 20km road distance, of a town with population >50,000.\\n\\nRegional Centres\\n\\nMMM 2-3\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\nAreas categorised as Inner Regional Australia or Outer Regional Australia in the ASGS-RA that are not in MM 2 and are in, or within 15km road distance, of a town with population between 15,000 and 50,000.\\n\\nRegional Areas\\n\\nMMM 4-5\\n\\n4\\n\\nAreas categorised as Inner Regional Australia or Outer Regional Australia in the ASGS-RA that are not in MM 2 or MM 3, and are in, or within 10km road distance, of a town with population between 5,000 and 15,000.\\n\\n5\\n\\nAll other areas categorised as Inner Regional Australia or Outer Regional Australia in the ASGS-RA, except areas on islands that have a population of less than 1,000 and are not classified as MM2, MM3 or MM4.\\n\\nRemote\\n\\nMMM 6\\n\\n6\\n\\nAll areas categorised as Remote Australia in the ASGS-RA, except areas on a populated island that is separated from the mainland and is more than 5km offshore; and Areas categorised as Inner Regional Australia or Outer Regional Australia in the ASGS-RA that are islands that have a population of less than 1,000 and are not otherwise classified.\\n\\nAll other areas – that being areas classified as Very Remote Australia in the ASGS-RA, and areas on a populated island that is separated from the mainland in the ABS geography and is more than 5km offshore.\\n\\nVery Remote\\n\\nMMM 7\\n\\n7\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 26 of 101\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nProviders and participants can determine the MMM rating of a location using the Health Workforce Locator tool on the Department of Health’s website.\\n\\nIsolated Towns Modification\\n\\nThe NDIA modifies the Modified Monash Model classification of some locations.

There is no additional loading applied for supports in Metropolitan areas, Regional Centres or Regional Areas. However, some different pricing arrangements do apply in Regional Areas (MMM4-5) as set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\n\\nWhen a support is provided directly to a participant, and the worker delivering the support is at the same location as the participant, the price limit that applies to the support is determined by the location of the participant at the time of service delivery. For example, if a participant living in a Remote location visits a provider to receive a service, the support is subject to the price limit that applies to that location – not the Remote price limit.\\n\\nWhen a support is provided directly to a participant via telehealth, the price limit that applies to the support should, in general, be the price limit that would apply if the participant was receiving the support at the place that the person who is delivering the support is located at the time of service delivery. However, participants in Remote or Very Remote areas can agree that those price limits should apply to the support if they are satisfied that the support provides value for money.\\n\\nWhen a support is not provided directly (for example, Non-Face-to-Face Support Provision or NDIA Requested Reports) then the price limit that applies to the support is the price limit that would apply if the participant was receiving the support at the place that the person who is delivering the support is located at the time of service delivery.\\n\\nClaiming for Group-Based Supports\\n\\nWhen a support item is delivered to more than one participant at the same time (a group of participants) then, unless the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits states otherwise, the price limit for each participant is the applicable price limit set out in the relevant support table divided by the number of participants in the group. Providers should make a claim for each participant using the relevant support item. Each claim should be for the total time of the support but is subject to the lower price limit as set out above.\\n\\nProviders can only claim for supports that are related to the reasonable and necessary needs of a participant. Where a participant attends a group-based session then a provider should only claim for the time of more than one worker against that participant’s plan if all those workers were involved in the direct support of the participant for the time claimed.\\n\\nThere are transitional arrangements in place for group-based supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation Support Category, see page 62.\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 28 of 101\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nPrograms of Support\\n\\nA provider of group-based supports in any of the following categories can enter into an agreement with a participant for a “program of support”, especially where the program is towards the achievement of a specified outcome:\\n\\nAny support in the Assistance in Shared Living Arrangements – Supported Independent\\n\\nLiving section of the Assistance with Daily Life Support Category;\\n\\nAny support in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation Support\\n\\nCategory, including Supports in Employment; and\\n\\nAny support in any Capacity Building Support Category.\\n\\nUnder this approach, providers claim against the plans of all the participants who had agreed to attend an instance of support in the program of support as though they had attended (whether or not they did) – as long as the provider had the capacity to deliver the support. Supports delivered as part of a program of supports are not subject to the short notice cancellation rules.\\n\\nNote: Providers in Registration Group 0118 (Early Intervention Supports for Early Childhood) can include 1:1 supports in a program of support but only where these are provided in combination with group supports.\\n\\nPrograms of support must be no longer than six months (unless specifically allowed for in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits; where a Program of Support is longer than 12 weeks, providers must ensure that participants have an opportunity to regularly review their program of support. Participants must be able to exit from a program of supports without cost, subject to a notice period of no more than two (2) weeks. Providers and participants can agree to a new Program of Support at any time.\\n\\nWhere a participant stops attending an agreed program of support but does not provide a notice, a provider may only continue claiming for a total of four (4) consecutive weeks from when the participant stopped attending. This is considered an unplanned exit. A provider is not able to continue to claim past four (4) consecutive weeks of non-attendance, unless the participant notifies the provider during that period that they wish to continue in the Program of Support.\\n\\nProviders who offer programs of support must enter into an agreement with each participant specifying the program of support, including its length, exit rules and intended outcomes. These agreements must be consistent with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. In particular, providers cannot pre-claim for programs of support. Each instance of support in the program of support has to be delivered before the provider can claim for that instance of support.\\n\\nClaiming for Centre Based Social, Economic and Community Participation Supports\\n\\nA provider in one of the following Registration Groups can claim an additional amount for the costs of running and maintaining a facility (Centre) through the relevant Centre Capital Cost support item when a support item (“the primary support”) in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation Support Category is delivered in the facility:\\n\\nHigh Intensity Daily Personal Activities (0104);\\n\\nSpecialised Supported Employment (0133); and\\n\\nGroup and Centre Based Activities (0136).\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 29 of 101\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nIf the primary support is being delivered to a group of participants, then the provider can claim up to price limit of the relevant Centre Capital Cost support item in respect of each of the participants for each hour of the support.\\n\\nWhen a support is delivered partially in a Centre and partially in the Community, and the Centre is available at all time during the support if required, then providers can claim up to the price limit for the relevant Centre Capital Cost support item for the entire period of the support.\\n\\nNote: These arrangements do not apply to providers who choose to use the transitional arrangements for group-based supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation Support Category, see page 62. The transitional price limits for these supports have the capital allowance built into them.\\n\\nCentre Capital Costs\\n\\nThe Centre Capital Cost support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\n\\nAs well as direct service provision, this support item can be used to claim for:\\n\\nShort Notice Cancellations.\\n\\nThese support items are subject to price limits as set out in the following Table.\\n\\nVery Remote\\n\\nItem Number\\n\\nItem Name and Notes\\n\\nUnit\\n\\nNational\\n\\nRemote\\n\\n04_599_0104_6_1\\n\\nCentre Capital Cost\\n\\nHour\\n\\n$2.44\\n\\n$3.42\\n\\n$3.66\\n\\n04_599_0133_5_1\\n\\nCentre Capital Cost\\n\\nHour\\n\\n$2.44\\n\\n$3.42\\n\\n$3.66\\n\\n04_599_0136_6_1\\n\\nCentre Capital Cost\\n\\nHour\\n\\n$2.44\\n\\n$3.42\\n\\n$3.66\\n\\n10_599_0133_5_3\\n\\nCentre Capital Cost\\n\\nHour\\n\\n$2.44\\n\\n$3.42\\n\\n$3.66\\n\\nClaiming for Establishment Fees for Personal Care/Participation Supports\\n\\nThese support items recognise the otherwise non-claimable costs that providers face in establishing arrangements with participants. They can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits\\n\\nThese support items are claimable by a provider who assists a participant with the implementation of their NDIS Plan, who has made an agreement with the participant to supply a minimum of 20 hours per month for three or more consecutive months of:\\n\\nPersonal Care Supports – that is, supports in the Activities of Daily Living Support Category\\n\\nthat are delivered by providers in the Registration Groups:\\n\\no Daily Personal Activities (0107); or\\n\\no High Intensity Daily Personal Activities (0104); or\\n\\nParticipation Supports – that is, supports in the Social, Economic and Community Participation Support Category delivered by providers in the Registration Groups:\\n\\no Participation in Community, Social and Civic Activities (0125); or\\n\\no Group and Centre Based Activities (0136); or\\n\\no High Intensity Daily Personal Activities (0104) when delivered for community access or\\n\\ngroup supports; or\\n\\no Specialised Supported Employment (0133).\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 30 of 101\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nEach provider can only claim an Establishment Fee in respect of a participant once across all plans.

Examples of situations where Irregular SIL Supports would be required include a participant falling ill or the cancellation of a day program, so that participants are in their home and require SIL supports for a period that was not initially planned and rostered for.\\n\\nClaims for Irregular SIL supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Irregular SIL Support” option in the myplace portal.\\n\\nSIL Providers are only permitted to claim from a participant’s plan for Irregular SIL Supports if all of the following conditions are met:\\n\\nThe NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\n\\nIrregular SIL Supports in respect of that support item;\\n\\nThe proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\n\\nPrice Limits;\\n\\nWhere the SIL activity does not sit within the definition of a Regular SIL Supports;\\n\\nThe provider works with the participant and/or their nominee to explain why Irregular SIL\\n\\nSupports are required, and the other options available; and\\n\\nThe provider has agreement from the participant and/or their nominee to claim for the support before a payment request is made (i.e., the service agreement between the participant and the provider should specify that Irregular SIL Supports can be claimed when required).\\n\\nIn contrast, Regular SIL supports (claimed as Direct Services) are considered as those planned for as part of a usual week in the SIL plan budget, via an agreement with the participant and provider based on the levels of care that can be provided within the approved SIL budget.\\n\\nThe SIL Operational Guideline provides more detail about the types of services that are included and excluded from the provision of SIL supports.\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 31 of 101\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nClaiming for more than one worker or therapist\\n\\nSometimes a participant requires assistance from more than one worker or therapist at the same time. In these cases, the provider is entitled to bill for the time spent providing the support by all workers and therapists involved in delivering the support. Examples of cases where this may occur include:\\n\\nShadow shifts that allow new workers to be introduced to a participant who has complex individual support needs so that they can understand their support needs and patterns;\\n\\nSupervision of, or specific training for, therapy assistants by the supervising therapist as part\\n\\nof the handover of the support delivery to the participant by the therapist to the therapy assistant;\\n\\nCase conferences between therapists about the specific support needs of a participant.\\n\\nShadow Shifts\\n\\nShadow shifts may be claimed where the participant has complex individual support needs that are best met by introducing a new worker to the participant before it is reasonable that they commence providing the support independently – for example, where the specific individual support needs include very limited communication; behaviour support needs; and/or medical needs/procedures such as ventilation or Home Enteral Nutrition (HEN).\\n\\nWhere the individual would require shadow shifts to assist with the introduction of new workers, and this is the desired method by the participant or their family, the provider may claim for up to 6 hours of weekday support per year.\\n\\nSupervision / Specific Training for Therapy Assistants\\n\\nLevel 1 Therapy Assistants can only deliver support under the direct supervision of a therapist. Level 2 Therapy Assistants can deliver supports under indirect supervision but may require specific training in the needs of the participant from the therapist before they take responsibility for the delivery of the therapy.\\n\\nIn these cases, it is appropriate for the provider to bill for the time spent by both the therapist and the therapy assistant. This arrangement can represent value for money for the participant compared to the alternative of all supports being delivered by the supervising therapists.\\n\\nCase Conferences for Therapists\\n\\nTherapists, especially in rural and remote areas, may benefit from a case conference with other therapists about the specific care needs of a participant. In these cases, it is appropriate for the provider to bill for the time spent by all therapists on the case conference.\\n\\nOther Considerations\\n\\nSupports must be Reasonable and Necessary\\n\\nThe NDIS provides funding to participants for supports and services aimed at increasing their independence, inclusion, and social and economic participation.\\n\\nSupports funded by the NDIS need to:\\n\\nBe related to the participant’s disability;\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 32 of 101\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nNot include day-to-day living costs that are not related to a participant’s disability support\\n\\nneeds;\\n\\nRepresent value for money; and\\n\\nBe likely to be effective and beneficial to the participant.\\n\\nProviders should not claim for supports from a participant’s plan where the support is not in line with the participant’s goals, objectives and aspirations as set out in their plan or where the support is not reasonable and necessary. Providers should also not claim for supports from a participant’s plan where the support is more appropriately funded or provided through other service systems. Further information on when a support is considered reasonable and necessary can be found on the NDIS website.\\n\\nMedicare and Insurance\\n\\nSome elements of a participant’s care may be covered by funds outside the NDIS. These expenses are commonly medical, including those covered by private health insurance or Medicare. These medical expenses are not funded under the NDIS, even if they are related to, or a symptom of, the disability. These expenses should be claimed under the relevant health care scheme or insurance policy. Some providers (e.g., therapists) may need to distinguish between the health services and disability supports that they provide to a single client, and make separate payment claims to, for example, Medicare and the NDIS.\\n\\nExpenses Related to Recreational Pursuits\\n\\nProviders should not claim payment from participant’s plans for:\\n\\nExpenses related to recreational pursuits, such as event tickets for the participant, as they\\n\\nare not covered by the NDIS; or\\n\\nThe cost of entry for a paid support worker to attend a social or recreational event.\\n\\nPrepayments\\n\\nIn general, Registered Providers can only make a claim for payment once a service booking has been created and the support has been delivered or provided.\\n\\nFor higher cost supports, the cost of the support may be claimed in stages in some circumstances, and before the support is finally delivered to the participant.\\n\\nPrepayments represent funds paid in advance of the provider delivering the agreed support to the participant. Sometimes providers require prepayment(s) as collateral and/or to cover their expenses in order to source, build or tailor the support to meet the participant’s unique needs.\\n\\nIn general, prepayments should only be sought where a business will incur unrecoverable costs should delivery of the support to the requesting participant not proceed (e.g., a custom-made support).\\n\\nPrepayments are subject to all of the following conditions:\\n\\nThe support item is an assistive technology (including vehicle modification), or a home\\n\\nmodification;\\n\\nThe support item value exceeds $1,500 or is custom made to address the participant’s\\n\\ndisability related requirements, and a valid quote has been provided and accepted by the participant (or their nominee);\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 33 of 101\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\na service agreement between the provider and participant (or nominee) outlines the\\n\\nrequirement of a prepayment (e.g., deposit) or milestone payments, in line with normal business practice; and\\n\\nThe final payment of not less than 10% of the total cost, may not be claimed until the\\n\\nparticipant has received the support ready for use.\\n\\nA participant is entitled to a refund of any balance of prepayment(s) less the actual unrecoverable expense incurred by the business to that point when supply is terminated. The participant remains fully entitled to their rights under Australian Consumer Law in all circumstances.\\n\\nPrepayments can be claimed by providers for a support where that support is specifically identified as eligible for prepayments in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Other supports may be eligible for prepayment where the NDIA has given prior written approval (including conditions) to the registered provider to claim for prepayments.\\n\\nSubscription services\\n\\nIn some cases, a provider may claim for a service agreed with a participant using a subscription model of payment. In these cases, the participant is paying to be able to use that service (on the terms/hours agreed) for the period of the subscription. Subscriptions may only be used for the supply of the following supports: Consumables (Support Category 03) and Assistive Technology (Support Category 05).\\n\\nProviders wanting to claim for a subscription-based service must make sure that:\\n\\nA plain English service agreement has been accepted by the participant, that makes clear to the participant the service and its costs (including any extra fees), as well as reasonable exit conditions\\n\\nThe maximum price limit for a subscription is $5,000 per annum.\\n\\nSubscriptions are to be charged monthly (paid at or before the start of the service period). Small subscriptions, where the annual cost is not more than $1,500, may be charged less frequently (quarterly or annually). For example, if a subscription service cost $199 per year, it could be charged for just once per year.\\n\\nThere are no penalties (for example exit fees) should a participant wish to cancel a subscription (with reasonable one month’s notice) on or prior to the end of the paid subscription period.\\n\\nInvoices for the subscription to be paid, clearly describe the supports for the participant to be delivered/available during the subscription period. For monthly subscriptions, participants may agree in writing to be billed quarterly (in advance of the quarter), but must be refunded any unused months if they cancel the subscription with due notice (as stated above).\\n\\nHigh value subscription claiming applies where the bundle of available Assistive Technology Products that a participant can access at any time is more than $15,000.\\n\\nUnder high value AT, all the conditions of the subscription services apply, with exception to the maximum price limit, which is set to $10,000 per annum.\\n\\nAdditional payments are permitted for high value AT subscriptions as follows:\\n\\na) freight and in-home technical setup costs may be claimed at the commencement of the\\n\\nsubscription;\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 34 of 101\\n\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n\\nb) removal, and return to provider’s agent nearest to the participant’s residence, of the supplied AT at the end of the subscription (which may coincide with the death of the participant); and\\n\\nc) each such claim under a) or b) shall not exceed one (1) month’s subscription fee or $600,\\n\\nwhichever is less.\\n\\nCo-payments for Capital items, including Assistive Technology\\n\\nIn general, providers are not permitted to request a co-payment by the participant for a support. However, where a participant would like a customisation to a support or assistive technology that is not considered reasonable or necessary, they are required to pay for these themselves. These may include an aesthetic customisation to an assistive technology or modifications to a vehicle that are additional to the assistive components.\\n\\nOther Fees and Charges\\n\\nAll registered providers must not add any other charge to the cost of the supports they provide to any participant, such as credit card surcharges, or any additional fees including any ‘gap’ fees, late payment fees or cancellation fees, unless otherwise permitted by the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Participants are generally not required to pay exit fees, even when changing provider’s part way through a plan. A core principle of the NDIS is choice and control for participants, allowing them to change providers without expense.\\n\\nGoods and Services Tax (GST)\\n\\nMany, but not all, NDIA supports provided to NDIS participants are GST-free. Further information about the NDIS and GST can be accessed on the Australian Taxation Office website. Providers should seek independent legal or financial advice if they require assistance with tax law compliance. If GST is applicable to a support, the price limit is inclusive of GST.\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 35 of 101\\n\\nSpecial NDIS Pricing Arrangements\\n\\nHigh Intensity Supports\\n\\nA support is considered a High Intensity support if it is a support provided to a participant:\\n\\nFor whom frequent (at least 1 instance per shift) assistance is required to manage challenging behaviours that require intensive positive behaviour support; and/or\\n\\nWho requires assistance from a disability support worker who has one or more of the high intensity support skills specified in the NDIS Commission’s NDIS Practice Standards: skills descriptors, which can be downloaded here.\\n\\nTemporary Transformation Payment (TTP)\\n\\nA number of supports in the Assistance with Daily Living Support Category and the Social, Economic and Community Participation Support Category are in the scope of the Temporary Transformation Payment (TTP). These supports have two support items, in line with the following example.\\n\\n01_011_0107_1_1\\n\\nAssistance With Self-Care Activities – Standard – Weekday Daytime\\n\\n01_011_0107_1_1_T\\n\\nAssistance With Self-Care Activities – Standard – Weekday Daytime – TTP\\n\\nThe price limit for each TTP item is higher than the price limit for the non-TTP item. The difference in price limits will be 1.5% of the standard price from 1 July 2023.\\n\\nAs with all supports, providers must also agree the price that they will charge for a support with the participant. The price for a support cannot be greater than the relevant price limit.\\n\\nThe TTP items can only be used by providers who are compliant with the TTP conditions (see below). Providers who meet these eligibility criteria are known as TTP providers.\\n\\nAll providers who claim for the TTP in 2023-24 must:\\n\\nPublish their service prices prominently on their website, and make them available to\\n\\nparticipants, including participants who are not their clients, and the NDIA on request; and\\n\\nList their business contact details in the Provider Finder in the myplace portal and ensure\\n\\nthat those details are kept up-to-date.\\n\\nIn addition, providers who made a claim for the TTP in 2022-23 can only claim for the TTP in 2023- 24 if they also took part in the Financial Benchmarking Survey that was carried out for the NDIA in 2021-22.\\n\\nAll providers who claim for a TTP support item are also required to acknowledge their compliance with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits, including the TTP requirements, when submitting a payment request through the myplace Provider Portal.\\n\\nProviders are reminded that Section 182 of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 provides that if a NDIS amount is paid to a person who is not entitled for any reason to the payment of the NDIS amount then the amount of the payment is a debt due to the Agency.\\n\\nPlan Managers and the TTP\\n\\nPlan managers are not responsible for ensuring providers are TTP compliant. They can accept the claim for a TTP support item by a registered provider as proof of TTP compliance. Plan managers\\n\\nPage 36 of 101\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nSpecial NDIS Pricing Arrangements\\n\\nare however required to inform the NDIA, when requested, which registered providers have made a claim for a TTP support item through the plan manager. Non-registered providers are not eligible for the TTP and plan managers should not use TTP line items to claim for services delivered by non-registered providers.\\n\\nDisability-Related Health Supports\\n\\nThe NDIS will fund disability-related health supports where these supports directly relate to a participant’s significant and permanent functional impairment and assist them to undertake activities of daily living. These supports are provided individually to participants and can be provided in a range of environments, including, but not limited to, the participant’s own home.\\n\\nParticipants are not permitted to claim for health supports from their plans when those health supports do not relate to their disability and when they do not require health supports on a regular basis. Those health supports will continue to be provided by the health system. Additionally, if a participant’s support needs become acute, that support should be provided in a hospital or another health setting by the relevant state/territory health care system or private health system and not be claimed from the participant’s plan.\\n\\nThe list below provides an indication of the majority of disability-related health supports that may be required by NDIS participants; however, it is not an exhaustive list. Disability-related health supports are expected to assist in areas such as:\\n\\nDysphagia: for participants who have trouble eating, drinking or swallowing on a daily basis.\\n\\nRespiratory: for participants requiring help with their breathing and maintenance of their\\n\\nrespiratory health, including any associated care, comfort, planning or supports\\n\\nNutrition: for participants requiring help with the way they eat or understanding the food they\\n\\nneed.\\n\\nDiabetes: for participants who have daily problems with how much sugar is in their blood.\\n\\nContinence: for participants who need daily assistance with toileting (bladder and bowel).\\n\\nWound & Pressure Care: for participants who need daily wound and pressure care\\n\\n(resulting from pressure wounds or swollen limbs).\\n\\nPodiatry: for participants who require help looking after their feet, ankles and lower limbs.\\n\\nEpilepsy: for participants who need daily help managing the way epilepsy affects the way\\n\\ntheir brain and nerves work.\\n\\nBotox and Splinting: It is unlikely Botox and splinting supports will be reasonable and necessary to include in a plan, as these are generally provided in a clinical setting.\\n\\nFive types of disability-related health supports have been identified in the NDIS Support Catalogue:\\n\\nProvision of Disability-Related Health Supports by Disability Support Workers – these\\n\\nsupports should be claimed using the standard Daily Personal Activities and High Intensity Daily Personal Activities support items;\\n\\nAssessment, planning and the provision of Disability-Related Health Supports by therapists these supports should be claimed using the standard early childhood and Therapy support items;\\n\\nAssessment, planning and the provision of Disability-Related Health Supports by nurses –\\n\\nthese supports should be claimed using the new nursing support items;\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 37 of 101\\n\\nSpecial NDIS Pricing Arrangements\\n\\nConsumables related to Disability Related Health Supports – these supports should be claimed using the new Low-Cost or High-Cost Disability Related Health Consumables support line items; and\\n\\nAssistive Technology related to Disability Related Health Supports – these supports should be claimed using the new Disability Related Health Assistive Technology support line items.\\n\\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Response\\n\\nThe Australian Government has enacted the Coronavirus Emergency Response Plan and the NDIA is taking necessary steps to prepare and support participants and providers during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The Agency is collaborating with the Department of Social Services, Services Australia and the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission as well as health agencies to deliver the NDIA’s Pandemic Plan in line with the Government’s Emergency Response Plan. Further information can be found at NDIS website.\\n\\nThe Agency is responding to the COVID-19 pandemic through a number of temporary measures. The details of these measures are provided in the COVID Addendum to the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits which can be downloaded here.\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 38 of 101\\n\\nCore – Assistance with Daily Life\\n\\nThis support category relates to assisting with or supervising personal tasks of daily life to enable the participant to live as autonomously as possible.

They recognise that, from time to time, participants may require temporary comprehensive supports that are different from their usual arrangements. These are non-typical days and may include Short Term Accommodation (STA) in a group-based facility. They may also include a period of respite, which aims to support ongoing caring arrangements between participants and their carers. STA/respite allows the opportunity for the participant to be supported by someone else whilst providing their carer with short term breaks from their usual caring responsibilities.\\n\\nThe support items include all expenses in a 24-hour period including assistance with self-care or community access activities, accommodation, food and negotiated activities. Typically, this type of support would be used for short periods of up to 14 days at a time (exceptions may be made). For longer-term arrangements, other options are likely to be more appropriate (e.g., Supported Independent Living or Medium Term Accommodation).\\n\\nIn cases where a participant will receive substantially less than 24 hours of assistance with daily personal activities, it may be appropriate for the participant and provider to negotiate a lower price than the maximum price specified in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits, based on the actual hours of support provided. This situation might arise, for example, if a participant enters a STA/respite facility in the evening, and exits again early the following morning. In addition, where a participant enters accommodation late in the day, it may be appropriate to claim the daily rate for the day of the week that the majority of the support is provided.\\n\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\n\\nAs well as direct service provision, these support items can be used to claim for:\\n\\nShort Notice Cancellations.\\n\\nThese support items are subject to price limits as set out in the following Table.

Specialist Support Coordination is delivered by an appropriately qualified and experienced practitioner to meet the individual needs of the participant’s circumstances such as a Psychologist, Occupational Therapist, Social Worker, or Mental Health Nurse. Specialist Support Coordination is expected to address complex barriers impacting a participant’s ability to implement their plan and access appropriate supports. Specialist Support Coordinators assist participants to reduce complexity in their support environment, and overcome barriers to connecting with broader systems of supports as well as funded supports.\\n\\nSpecialist Support Coordinators are expected to negotiate appropriate support solutions with multiple stakeholders and seek to achieve well-coordinated plan implementation. Specialist Support Coordinators will assist stakeholders with resolving points of crisis for participants, assist to ensure a consistent delivery of service and access to relevant supports during crisis situations.\\n\\nSpecialist Support Coordination is generally delivered through an intensive and time limited period necessitated by the participant’s immediate and significant barriers to plan implementation. Depending on individual circumstances, a Specialist Support Coordinator may also design a complex service plan that focusses on how all the stakeholders in a participant’s life will interact to resolve barriers and promote appropriate plan implementation. Once developed, a Specialist Support Coordinator will continue to monitor the plan, but it may be maintained by one of the participant’s support workers or other care supports.\\n\\nSpecialist Support Coordination includes, but is not limited to\\n\\nUnderstand the Plan;\\n\\nConnect with Supports and Services;\\n\\nDesign Support Approaches;\\n\\nEstablish Supports;\\n\\nCoach, Refine, Reflect;\\n\\nTargeted Support Coordination;\\n\\nCrisis: Planning, Prevention, Mitigation and Action;\\n\\nAddress Complex Barriers;\\n\\nDesign Complex Service Plan;\\n\\nBuild Capacity and Resilience; and\\n\\nReport to the NDIA.\\n\\nThis support item can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\n\\nAs well as direct service provision, these support items can be used to claim for:\\n\\nNon-Face-to-Face Support Provision\\n\\nProvider Travel\\n\\nShort Notice Cancellations\\n\\nNDIA Requested Reports.\\n\\nProviders of this support can also claim for the costs of:\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 75 of 101\\n\\nCapacity Building – Support Coordination\\n\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs using the support item 07_799_0132_8_3 or\\n\\n01_799_0132_1_1.\\n\\nThis support item is subject to price limits as set out in the following Table.\\n\\nVery Remote\\n\\nItem Number\\n\\nItem Name and Notes\\n\\nUnit\\n\\nNational\\n\\nRemote\\n\\nSupport Coordination Level 3: Specialist Support Coordination\\n\\n07_004_0132_8_3\\n\\nHour\\n\\n$190.54\\n\\n$266.75\\n\\n$285.80\\n\\nPsychosocial Recovery Coaches\\n\\nThese support items provide assistance for participants to build capacity and resilience through strong and respectful relationships to support people with psychosocial disability to live a full and contributing life.

They are available during the final months at school and continue post school exit. These supports are designed to plan and implement a pathway to inclusive employment, focussing on capacity building for goal achievement. With appropriate supports, it is expected that the majority of SLES participants will transition to the Disability Employment Service (DES) to undertake the job seeking, placement and post placement support phases of their pathway. These supports will have an individualised approach, with a strong emphasis on “try and test” work experience opportunities, (generally in work places that would pay award wages). Capacity building should focus on hard and soft skill development. Supports, more generally, should facilitate positive experiences that contribute to developing an understanding of work capability and confidence to step into employment. SLES should also help inform the level and nature of future supports needed to obtain and sustain employment.\\n\\nThis support item can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.

Therapy supports are for participants with an established disability to facilitate functional improvement, where maximum medical improvement has been reached. For people who access the Scheme as ‘early intervention’ participants, reasonable and necessary supports are likely to be a blend of medical and disability therapies but should be predominantly disability therapy supports. Therapy must be aimed at adjustment, adaption, and building capacity for community participation.\\n\\nMaintenance care can be claimed against a participant’s plan, where the primary purpose is to provide ongoing support for a participant to maintain a level of functioning including long term therapy/support required to achieve small incremental gains or to prevent functional decline. In general, maintenance therapy that is reasonable and necessary should be delivered by carers who are or can be trained in this if required. Where a participant has a medical condition or disability that requires a particular regime to maintain functioning of a body part, or to slow the deterioration of a medical condition or body part, then these support items can be used to deliver reasonable and necessary training for non-qualified personnel to assist a participant, as part of usual daily care. These support items cannot be used for massage, delivered directly to impact a body part or body system, as these supports are more appropriately funded by the health system.\\n\\nThese support items can also be used for the assessment, planning, and delivery of Disability- Related Health Supports where these supports directly relate to a participant’s significant and permanent functional impairment and assist them to undertake activities of daily living.\\n\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants or to groups of participants subject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. In particular, these support items can only be delivered by the following types of professionals, and by therapy assistants operating under the delegation and supervision of one of the following types of professionals:\\n\\nArt Therapist – A person who is a Professional Member with the Australian, New Zealand\\n\\nand Asian Creative Arts Therapy Association (ANZACATA).\\n\\nAudiologist – A person who is either currently certified as an Audiology Australia Accredited Audiologist by Audiology Australia or as a Full Member as an audiologist with the Australian College of Audiology.\\n\\nCounsellor – A person who is either a member of the Australian Counselling Association or\\n\\nan accredited Registrant with the Psychotherapy and Counselling Federation of Australia.\\n\\nDevelopmental Educator – A person who is a Full Member of Developmental Educators\\n\\nAustralia Inc.\\n\\nDietitian – A person who is an Accredited Practising Dietitian with the Dietitians Australia.\\n\\nExercise Physiologist – A person who is an Accredited exercise physiologist with Exercise\\n\\nand Sports Science Australia.\\n\\nMusic Therapist – A person who is an Active “Registered Music Therapist” with the\\n\\nAustralian Music Therapy Association.\\n\\nOccupational Therapist – A person who has a current Australian Health Practitioner\\n\\nRegulation Agency (AHPRA) Registration as an Occupational Therapist.\\n\\nOrthoptist – A person who has current registration with the Australian Orthoptic Board.\\n\\nPhysiotherapist – A person who has a current AHPRA Registration as a Physiotherapist.\\n\\nPodiatrist – A person who has a current AHPRA Registration as a Podiatrist.\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 92 of 101\\n\\nCapacity Building – Improved Daily Living\\n\\nPsychologist – A person who has a current AHPRA Registration as a Psychologist.\\n\\nRehabilitation Counsellor – A person who is member of the Australian Society of\\n\\nRehabilitation Counsellors Inc. or equivalent.\\n\\nSocial Worker – A person who is a member of the Australian Association of Social Workers.\\n\\nSpeech Pathologist – A person who is a Certified Practising Speech Pathologist (CPSP) as\\n\\napproved by Speech Pathology Australia.\\n\\nOther Professional – A person who is not one of the types of professionals listed above but who the provider considers to be an appropriate professional to deliver therapeutic supports in line with the NDIS Quality and Safeguarding Commission’s requirements for the Therapeutic Supports Registration Group.\\n\\nNote: Therapists who do not meet the above definitions but who have been accepted by an approved quality auditor of the NDIS Commission as having the relevant qualifications, expertise and experience should use the “Other Professional” support item.\\n\\nNote: Where a support is delivered by a therapy assistant, the therapy assistant must be covered by the professional indemnity insurance of the supervising therapist (or the therapist's or therapy assistant's employing provider).\\n\\nAs well as direct service provision, these support items can be used to claim for:\\n\\nNon-Face-to-Face Support Provision\\n\\nProvider Travel\\n\\nShort Notice Cancellations\\n\\nNDIA Requested Reports\\n\\nProviders of this support can also claim for the costs of:\\n\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs using support item 15_799_0114_1_3 or\\n\\n15_799_0126_1_3 or 15_799_0128_1_3, depending on their Registration Group.\\n\\nThese support items are subject to the price limits set out in the following Table.

In the case of computer tablets or iPads for telehealth and care or participating in online video classes, advice from AT specialists is that most NDIS participants will not need more than a standard tablet, which costs no more than $600.\\n\\nThe following items and circumstances are excluded from this policy:\\n\\nThe item does not relate to the participants disability. A participant cannot purchase a smart\\n\\ndevice for entertainment, education, or gaming. A participant cannot purchase fitness equipment not previously used or recommended by the participant’s provider or therapist in existing funded supports.\\n\\nDevices with extra specifications above the basic model. A participant can only purchase\\n\\ndevice that is fit for purpose for maintaining NDIS funded supports. The NDIS will generally fund the lowest specification. Top of the range specifications can only be justified if they are required as a result of a person’s disability. For example, Therabands and a fitness ball may\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 99 of 101\\n\\nCapacity Building – Improved Daily Living\\n\\nbe sufficient to maintain an exercise program rather than a gym set. In the case of computer solutions, only participants who require ‘head tracking’ and other solutions are likely to need a large screen tablet or iPad, most other participants would only require an entry-level tablet. You should consult a specialised AT provider to advise you on any more complex products before making a purchase.\\n\\nSmart phones, tablets, or iPads with mobile connections cannot be purchased. Video\\n\\nconferencing and other functionality participants will need to access supports is available on tablets, iPads, or computers that are in scope and connect using Wi-Fi.\\n\\nParticipants cannot purchase multiple devices. A single item can be purchased, where the participant does not already own or have access to a device that would meet their needs to continue to access supports and services. This includes if the participant already owns or has access to a suitable device through:\\n\\no existing individual or family ownership\\n\\no employment (for the purpose of working remotely)\\n\\no education (for the purpose of studying remotely)\\n\\nReplacements for loss or damage will generally follow the existing NDIS AT replacement policy (noting that replacement of items will generally not apply once this policy ends).\\n\\nInternet connection and data, these are considered ordinary living costs (utilities) and are\\n\\nexcluded from this policy.\\n\\nThis policy will not fund applications or software, however apps that have been specified and\\n\\napproved in a plan can be paid for with NDIS funding.\\n\\nAdditional hardware or accessories, other than standard protective cases will not be funded by the NDIS. This includes: screen protectors, additional or back up chargers, selfie sticks, connection cables\\n\\nAdditional hardware and accessories may be purchased if they relate to using the device because of the participant’s disability, such as mounting on a wheelchair for a person with limited grip or rugged case where related to behaviour issues.\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\\n\\nPage 100 of 101\\n\\nAppendix A: History of Changes\\n\\nVersion 1.0\\n\\nPage(s)\\n\\nDetails of Amendment NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24\\n\\nDate Published 16 June 2023\\n\\nDate of Effect 1 July 2023\\n\\nPage 101 of 101\\n\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023)\", metadata={'source': '../../data/ndis/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf'})]"

However, research\\nundertaken by a capacity-building provider specifically linked to the needs of a participant and to\\nthe achievement of the participant’s goals may be billable as a Non-Face-to-Face support with the\\nparticipant’s prior agreement.\\nService agreements with each client can ‘pre-authorise’ these activities, but providers should only\\nclaim a support item from a participant’s plan if they have completed activities that are part of the\\nsupport for that participant.

Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 11 of 101\\n\\t4. Lifelong Learning\\t\\t\\t8. Choice and ControlSupport Purposes, Support Categories and Support Items\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n4. Lifelong Learning 8. Choice and Control\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must\\ncontribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan. Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101', metadata={'title': 'NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24', 'source': '/workspaces/IsabelleLangchain/src/ndis/../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'timestamp': '2023-08-06T09:01:37.029528', 'start_page': 11, 'end_page': 15}), 0.44298630952835083)]\n",

(Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 11 of 101\\n\\t4. Lifelong Learning\\t\\t\\t8. Choice and ControlSupport Purposes, Support Categories and Support Items\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n4. Lifelong Learning 8. Choice and Control\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must\\ncontribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan. Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and\\nproviders to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant’s goals.\\nThe following table shows the links between support purpose types, domains in the Outcomes\\nFramework and support categories.\\nPURPOSE OUTCOME DOMAIN 1.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101', metadata={'title': 'NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24', 'source': '/workspaces/IsabelleLangchain/src/ndis/../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'timestamp': '2023-08-06T09:01:37.029528', 'start_page': 11, 'end_page': 15})], 'question': 'What item code should I use when invoicing for a participant?

Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel. The non-labour costs should be claimed against the\\nrelevant “Provider Travel – non-labour costs” support item as indicated in the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits.\\nSupport items\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a worker is travelling to provide services to\\nmore than one participant in a ‘region’ then the provider should apportion the non-labour travel\\ncosts (including the return journey where applicable) between the participants, with the agreement\\nof each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7.

Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and\\nproviders to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant’s goals.\\nThe following table shows the links between support purpose types, domains in the Outcomes\\nFramework and support categories.\\nPURPOSE OUTCOME DOMAIN 1.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101'}\n",

Providers should assist participants to minimise the travel\\ncosts that they need to pay (for example, by co-ordinating appointments with other participants in\\nan area, so that travel costs can be shared between participants, or by considering the delivery of\\nthe support by telehealth where appropriate).\\nShort Notice Cancellations\\nWhere a provider has a Short Notice Cancellation (or no show), they are able to claim 100% of the\\nagreed fee associated with the activity from the participant’s plan, subject to the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits and the terms of the service agreement with the participant.\\nA cancellation is a short notice cancellation if the participant:\\n• Does not show up for a scheduled support within a reasonable time, or is not present at the\\nagreed place and within a reasonable time when the provider is travelling to deliver the\\nsupport; or\\n• Has given less than seven (7) clear days’ notice for a support.\\nFor supports delivered to a group of participants, if a participant cancels their attendance and if the\\nprovider is unable find another participant to attend the group session in their place then, if the\\nother requirements for a short notice cancellation are met, the provider is permitted to bill the\\nparticipant who has made the short notice cancellation at the previously agreed rate that they\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 22 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\t\\n\\tA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\t\\n\\tThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\t\\n\\tnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\t\\n\\twould have been spent providing the support.\\t\\n\\tIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\t\\n\\tprovider can claim for this support.

All other participants in the group\\nshould also be billed as though all participants had attended the group.\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a Short Notice Cancellation of the delivery of\\na support item to the participant if all of the following conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for Short\\nNotice Cancellations in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify that Short Notice Cancellations can be\\nclaimed); and\\n• The provider was not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and are\\nrequired to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.\\nClaims for a short notice cancellation should be made using the same support item as would have\\nbeen used if the support had been delivered, using the “Cancellation” option in the myplace portal.\\nThere is no hard limit on the number of short notice cancellations (or no shows) for which a\\nprovider can claim in respect of a participant. However, providers have a duty of care to their\\nparticipants and if a participant has an unusual number of cancellations, then the provider should\\nseek to understand why they are occurring. The NDIA will monitor claims for cancellations and may\\ncontact providers who have a participant with an unusual number of cancellations.\\nExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\nA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\nThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\nnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\nwould have been spent providing the support.\\nIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\nprovider can claim for this support. The claim should be made at the agreed rate for the service against the relevant\\nsupport item using the drop-down field “Cancellation”.\\nNDIA Requested Reports\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a NDIA Requested Report if all of the\\nfollowing conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for NDIA\\nRequested Reports in respect of that support item and the proposed charges for the activities\\ncomply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (i.e., the service agreement\\nwith the participant should specify that NDIA Requested Reports can be claimed); and\\n• The report is requested by the NDIA.\\nA report is considered to have been requested by the NDIA if it is a report that is required at the\\ncommencement of a plan that outlines plan objectives and goals, or at plan review that measures\\nfunctional outcomes against the originally stipulated goals, or that makes recommendations for\\nongoing needs (informal, community, mainstream or funded supports). Providers may also claim\\nfor other NDIA-requested therapy report that is stipulated as being required in a participant’s plan.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 23 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaims for NDIS requested reports should be made using the relevant support item, using the\\n“NDIA Report” option in the myplace portal.\\nClaiming for Activity Based Transport\\nActivity Based Transport – Social, Economic and Community Participation Supports\\nProviders of supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation\\nSupport Category (“community participation supports”) can, at the request of a participant,\\ntransport a participant to, or from, or as part of, a community participation support. In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

Providers should assist participants to minimise the travel\\ncosts that they need to pay (for example, by co-ordinating appointments with other participants in\\nan area, so that travel costs can be shared between participants, or by considering the delivery of\\nthe support by telehealth where appropriate).\\nShort Notice Cancellations\\nWhere a provider has a Short Notice Cancellation (or no show), they are able to claim 100% of the\\nagreed fee associated with the activity from the participant’s plan, subject to the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits and the terms of the service agreement with the participant.\\nA cancellation is a short notice cancellation if the participant:\\n• Does not show up for a scheduled support within a reasonable time, or is not present at the\\nagreed place and within a reasonable time when the provider is travelling to deliver the\\nsupport; or\\n• Has given less than seven (7) clear days’ notice for a support.\\nFor supports delivered to a group of participants, if a participant cancels their attendance and if the\\nprovider is unable find another participant to attend the group session in their place then, if the\\nother requirements for a short notice cancellation are met, the provider is permitted to bill the\\nparticipant who has made the short notice cancellation at the previously agreed rate that they\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 22 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\t\\n\\tA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\t\\n\\tThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\t\\n\\tnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\t\\n\\twould have been spent providing the support.\\t\\n\\tIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\t\\n\\tprovider can claim for this support.

All other participants in the group\\nshould also be billed as though all participants had attended the group.\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a Short Notice Cancellation of the delivery of\\na support item to the participant if all of the following conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for Short\\nNotice Cancellations in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify that Short Notice Cancellations can be\\nclaimed); and\\n• The provider was not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and are\\nrequired to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.\\nClaims for a short notice cancellation should be made using the same support item as would have\\nbeen used if the support had been delivered, using the “Cancellation” option in the myplace portal.\\nThere is no hard limit on the number of short notice cancellations (or no shows) for which a\\nprovider can claim in respect of a participant. However, providers have a duty of care to their\\nparticipants and if a participant has an unusual number of cancellations, then the provider should\\nseek to understand why they are occurring. The NDIA will monitor claims for cancellations and may\\ncontact providers who have a participant with an unusual number of cancellations.\\nExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\nA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\nThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\nnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\nwould have been spent providing the support.\\nIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\nprovider can claim for this support. The claim should be made at the agreed rate for the service against the relevant\\nsupport item using the drop-down field “Cancellation”.\\nNDIA Requested Reports\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a NDIA Requested Report if all of the\\nfollowing conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for NDIA\\nRequested Reports in respect of that support item and the proposed charges for the activities\\ncomply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (i.e., the service agreement\\nwith the participant should specify that NDIA Requested Reports can be claimed); and\\n• The report is requested by the NDIA.\\nA report is considered to have been requested by the NDIA if it is a report that is required at the\\ncommencement of a plan that outlines plan objectives and goals, or at plan review that measures\\nfunctional outcomes against the originally stipulated goals, or that makes recommendations for\\nongoing needs (informal, community, mainstream or funded supports). Providers may also claim\\nfor other NDIA-requested therapy report that is stipulated as being required in a participant’s plan.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 23 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaims for NDIS requested reports should be made using the relevant support item, using the\\n“NDIA Report” option in the myplace portal.\\nClaiming for Activity Based Transport\\nActivity Based Transport – Social, Economic and Community Participation Supports\\nProviders of supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation\\nSupport Category (“community participation supports”) can, at the request of a participant,\\ntransport a participant to, or from, or as part of, a community participation support. In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

However, research\\nundertaken by a capacity-building provider specifically linked to the needs of a participant and to\\nthe achievement of the participant’s goals may be billable as a Non-Face-to-Face support with the\\nparticipant’s prior agreement.\\nService agreements with each client can ‘pre-authorise’ these activities, but providers should only\\nclaim a support item from a participant’s plan if they have completed activities that are part of the\\nsupport for that participant.

Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 11 of 101\\n\\t4. Lifelong Learning\\t\\t\\t8. Choice and ControlSupport Purposes, Support Categories and Support Items\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n4. Lifelong Learning 8. Choice and Control\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must\\ncontribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan. Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101', metadata={'title': 'NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24', 'source': '/workspaces/IsabelleLangchain/src/ndis/../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'timestamp': '2023-08-06T09:01:37.029528', 'start_page': 11, 'end_page': 15}), 0.44298630952835083)]\n",

(Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 11 of 101\\n\\t4. Lifelong Learning\\t\\t\\t8. Choice and ControlSupport Purposes, Support Categories and Support Items\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n4. Lifelong Learning 8. Choice and Control\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must\\ncontribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan. Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and\\nproviders to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant’s goals.\\nThe following table shows the links between support purpose types, domains in the Outcomes\\nFramework and support categories.\\nPURPOSE OUTCOME DOMAIN 1.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101', metadata={'title': 'NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24', 'source': '/workspaces/IsabelleLangchain/src/ndis/../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'timestamp': '2023-08-06T09:01:37.029528', 'start_page': 11, 'end_page': 15})], 'question': 'What item code should I use when invoicing for a participant?

Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel. The non-labour costs should be claimed against the\\nrelevant “Provider Travel – non-labour costs” support item as indicated in the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits.\\nSupport items\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a worker is travelling to provide services to\\nmore than one participant in a ‘region’ then the provider should apportion the non-labour travel\\ncosts (including the return journey where applicable) between the participants, with the agreement\\nof each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7.

Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and\\nproviders to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant’s goals.\\nThe following table shows the links between support purpose types, domains in the Outcomes\\nFramework and support categories.\\nPURPOSE OUTCOME DOMAIN 1.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101'}\n",

Providers should assist participants to minimise the travel\\ncosts that they need to pay (for example, by co-ordinating appointments with other participants in\\nan area, so that travel costs can be shared between participants, or by considering the delivery of\\nthe support by telehealth where appropriate).\\nShort Notice Cancellations\\nWhere a provider has a Short Notice Cancellation (or no show), they are able to claim 100% of the\\nagreed fee associated with the activity from the participant’s plan, subject to the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits and the terms of the service agreement with the participant.\\nA cancellation is a short notice cancellation if the participant:\\n• Does not show up for a scheduled support within a reasonable time, or is not present at the\\nagreed place and within a reasonable time when the provider is travelling to deliver the\\nsupport; or\\n• Has given less than seven (7) clear days’ notice for a support.\\nFor supports delivered to a group of participants, if a participant cancels their attendance and if the\\nprovider is unable find another participant to attend the group session in their place then, if the\\nother requirements for a short notice cancellation are met, the provider is permitted to bill the\\nparticipant who has made the short notice cancellation at the previously agreed rate that they\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 22 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\t\\n\\tA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\t\\n\\tThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\t\\n\\tnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\t\\n\\twould have been spent providing the support.\\t\\n\\tIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\t\\n\\tprovider can claim for this support.

All other participants in the group\\nshould also be billed as though all participants had attended the group.\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a Short Notice Cancellation of the delivery of\\na support item to the participant if all of the following conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for Short\\nNotice Cancellations in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify that Short Notice Cancellations can be\\nclaimed); and\\n• The provider was not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and are\\nrequired to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.\\nClaims for a short notice cancellation should be made using the same support item as would have\\nbeen used if the support had been delivered, using the “Cancellation” option in the myplace portal.\\nThere is no hard limit on the number of short notice cancellations (or no shows) for which a\\nprovider can claim in respect of a participant. However, providers have a duty of care to their\\nparticipants and if a participant has an unusual number of cancellations, then the provider should\\nseek to understand why they are occurring. The NDIA will monitor claims for cancellations and may\\ncontact providers who have a participant with an unusual number of cancellations.\\nExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\nA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\nThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\nnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\nwould have been spent providing the support.\\nIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\nprovider can claim for this support. The claim should be made at the agreed rate for the service against the relevant\\nsupport item using the drop-down field “Cancellation”.\\nNDIA Requested Reports\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a NDIA Requested Report if all of the\\nfollowing conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for NDIA\\nRequested Reports in respect of that support item and the proposed charges for the activities\\ncomply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (i.e., the service agreement\\nwith the participant should specify that NDIA Requested Reports can be claimed); and\\n• The report is requested by the NDIA.\\nA report is considered to have been requested by the NDIA if it is a report that is required at the\\ncommencement of a plan that outlines plan objectives and goals, or at plan review that measures\\nfunctional outcomes against the originally stipulated goals, or that makes recommendations for\\nongoing needs (informal, community, mainstream or funded supports). Providers may also claim\\nfor other NDIA-requested therapy report that is stipulated as being required in a participant’s plan.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 23 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaims for NDIS requested reports should be made using the relevant support item, using the\\n“NDIA Report” option in the myplace portal.\\nClaiming for Activity Based Transport\\nActivity Based Transport – Social, Economic and Community Participation Supports\\nProviders of supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation\\nSupport Category (“community participation supports”) can, at the request of a participant,\\ntransport a participant to, or from, or as part of, a community participation support. In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

Providers should assist participants to minimise the travel\\ncosts that they need to pay (for example, by co-ordinating appointments with other participants in\\nan area, so that travel costs can be shared between participants, or by considering the delivery of\\nthe support by telehealth where appropriate).\\nShort Notice Cancellations\\nWhere a provider has a Short Notice Cancellation (or no show), they are able to claim 100% of the\\nagreed fee associated with the activity from the participant’s plan, subject to the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits and the terms of the service agreement with the participant.\\nA cancellation is a short notice cancellation if the participant:\\n• Does not show up for a scheduled support within a reasonable time, or is not present at the\\nagreed place and within a reasonable time when the provider is travelling to deliver the\\nsupport; or\\n• Has given less than seven (7) clear days’ notice for a support.\\nFor supports delivered to a group of participants, if a participant cancels their attendance and if the\\nprovider is unable find another participant to attend the group session in their place then, if the\\nother requirements for a short notice cancellation are met, the provider is permitted to bill the\\nparticipant who has made the short notice cancellation at the previously agreed rate that they\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 22 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\t\\n\\tA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\t\\n\\tThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\t\\n\\tnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\t\\n\\twould have been spent providing the support.\\t\\n\\tIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\t\\n\\tprovider can claim for this support.

All other participants in the group\\nshould also be billed as though all participants had attended the group.\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a Short Notice Cancellation of the delivery of\\na support item to the participant if all of the following conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for Short\\nNotice Cancellations in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify that Short Notice Cancellations can be\\nclaimed); and\\n• The provider was not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and are\\nrequired to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.\\nClaims for a short notice cancellation should be made using the same support item as would have\\nbeen used if the support had been delivered, using the “Cancellation” option in the myplace portal.\\nThere is no hard limit on the number of short notice cancellations (or no shows) for which a\\nprovider can claim in respect of a participant. However, providers have a duty of care to their\\nparticipants and if a participant has an unusual number of cancellations, then the provider should\\nseek to understand why they are occurring. The NDIA will monitor claims for cancellations and may\\ncontact providers who have a participant with an unusual number of cancellations.\\nExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\nA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\nThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\nnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\nwould have been spent providing the support.\\nIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\nprovider can claim for this support. The claim should be made at the agreed rate for the service against the relevant\\nsupport item using the drop-down field “Cancellation”.\\nNDIA Requested Reports\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a NDIA Requested Report if all of the\\nfollowing conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for NDIA\\nRequested Reports in respect of that support item and the proposed charges for the activities\\ncomply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (i.e., the service agreement\\nwith the participant should specify that NDIA Requested Reports can be claimed); and\\n• The report is requested by the NDIA.\\nA report is considered to have been requested by the NDIA if it is a report that is required at the\\ncommencement of a plan that outlines plan objectives and goals, or at plan review that measures\\nfunctional outcomes against the originally stipulated goals, or that makes recommendations for\\nongoing needs (informal, community, mainstream or funded supports). Providers may also claim\\nfor other NDIA-requested therapy report that is stipulated as being required in a participant’s plan.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 23 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaims for NDIS requested reports should be made using the relevant support item, using the\\n“NDIA Report” option in the myplace portal.\\nClaiming for Activity Based Transport\\nActivity Based Transport – Social, Economic and Community Participation Supports\\nProviders of supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation\\nSupport Category (“community participation supports”) can, at the request of a participant,\\ntransport a participant to, or from, or as part of, a community participation support. In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

However, research\\nundertaken by a capacity-building provider specifically linked to the needs of a participant and to\\nthe achievement of the participant’s goals may be billable as a Non-Face-to-Face support with the\\nparticipant’s prior agreement.\\nService agreements with each client can ‘pre-authorise’ these activities, but providers should only\\nclaim a support item from a participant’s plan if they have completed activities that are part of the\\nsupport for that participant. Charging a fee that is not linked to completed activities is not permitted.\\nTime spent on administration, such as the processing of NDIS payment claims for all clients,\\nshould not be claimed from a participant’s budget as a Non-Face-to-Face support. The NDIS price\\nlimits include an allowance for overheads, including the costs of administration tasks. Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel. The non-labour costs should be claimed against the\\nrelevant “Provider Travel – non-labour costs” support item as indicated in the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits.\\nSupport items\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a worker is travelling to provide services to\\nmore than one participant in a ‘region’ then the provider should apportion the non-labour travel\\ncosts (including the return journey where applicable) between the participants, with the agreement\\nof each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

However, research\\nundertaken by a capacity-building provider specifically linked to the needs of a participant and to\\nthe achievement of the participant’s goals may be billable as a Non-Face-to-Face support with the\\nparticipant’s prior agreement.\\nService agreements with each client can ‘pre-authorise’ these activities, but providers should only\\nclaim a support item from a participant’s plan if they have completed activities that are part of the\\nsupport for that participant. Charging a fee that is not linked to completed activities is not permitted.\\nTime spent on administration, such as the processing of NDIS payment claims for all clients,\\nshould not be claimed from a participant’s budget as a Non-Face-to-Face support. The NDIS price\\nlimits include an allowance for overheads, including the costs of administration tasks. Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel. The non-labour costs should be claimed against the\\nrelevant “Provider Travel – non-labour costs” support item as indicated in the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits.\\nSupport items\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a worker is travelling to provide services to\\nmore than one participant in a ‘region’ then the provider should apportion the non-labour travel\\ncosts (including the return journey where applicable) between the participants, with the agreement\\nof each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

Charging a fee that is not linked to completed activities is not permitted.\\nTime spent on administration, such as the processing of NDIS payment claims for all clients,\\nshould not be claimed from a participant’s budget as a Non-Face-to-Face support. The NDIS price\\nlimits include an allowance for overheads, including the costs of administration tasks. Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel. The non-labour costs should be claimed against the\\nrelevant “Provider Travel – non-labour costs” support item as indicated in the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits.\\nSupport items\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a worker is travelling to provide services to\\nmore than one participant in a ‘region’ then the provider should apportion the non-labour travel\\ncosts (including the return journey where applicable) between the participants, with the agreement\\nof each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

This support item\\nincludes up to two hours of active supports provided to the participant for the duration of the period.\\nProviders may claim for the third or additional hour at Saturday rates on weekdays, or at applicable\\nrates on other days (Saturday, Sunday or Public Holidays).\\nNote, there is no night-time sleepover support item for nurses.\\nClaiming for Telehealth Services\\nTelehealth can be used to deliver direct supports where appropriate and with the agreement of the\\nparticipant.\\nProviders can only claim Telehealth Services where the following conditions are met:\\n• The delivery of the support by telehealth is appropriate; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and with the Service Agreement with the participant; and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant (rather\\nthan a general activity such as enrolment, administration or staff rostering); and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider specifies that Telehealth services can be claimed).\\nProviders have a duty of care to their participants to ensure they are providing the same standard\\nof care through video technology as in a clinical setting.\\nClaims for Telehealth Services should be made using the relevant support item as indicated in\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits by using the “Telehealth Services” option in the\\nmyplace portal.\\nClaiming for Non-direct Services\\nNon-Face-to-Face Support Provision\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for the Non-Face-to-Face delivery of a support\\nitem if all of the following conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for Non-\\nFace-to-Face Support Provision in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and with the Service Agreement with the participant; and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant or in\\nthe case of group-based supports, are required to enable the group support to be delivered\\n(rather than a general activity such as enrolment, administration or staff rostering); and\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 17 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider specifies that Non-Face-to-Face supports can be\\nclaimed).\\nFor example, the Assistance with Self Care support items are described as covering activities\\n“Assisting with, and/or supervising, personal tasks of daily life to develop skills of the participant to\\nlive as autonomously as possible”. Therefore, time spent on Non-Face-to-Face activities that assist\\nthe participant – for example, writing reports for co-workers and other providers about the client’s\\nprogress with skill development – could be claimed against this support item.\\nThe costs of training and up-skilling staff, and of supervision, are included in the base price limits\\nfor supports and are not considered billable Non-Face-to-Face supports. However, research\\nundertaken by a capacity-building provider specifically linked to the needs of a participant and to\\nthe achievement of the participant’s goals may be billable as a Non-Face-to-Face support with the\\nparticipant’s prior agreement.\\nService agreements with each client can ‘pre-authorise’ these activities, but providers should only\\nclaim a support item from a participant’s plan if they have completed activities that are part of the\\nsupport for that participant. Charging a fee that is not linked to completed activities is not permitted.\\nTime spent on administration, such as the processing of NDIS payment claims for all clients,\\nshould not be claimed from a participant’s budget as a Non-Face-to-Face support. The NDIS price\\nlimits include an allowance for overheads, including the costs of administration tasks. Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel. The non-labour costs should be claimed against the\\nrelevant “Provider Travel – non-labour costs” support item as indicated in the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits.\\nSupport items\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a worker is travelling to provide services to\\nmore than one participant in a ‘region’ then the provider should apportion the non-labour travel\\ncosts (including the return journey where applicable) between the participants, with the agreement\\nof each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.
